radio's on, feeling all right 
cruising the strip on a saturday night. 
i smile and i wave and i hide all my pain 
but the sign on my bumper gives me away: 

honk if you're lonely tonight 
if you need a friend to get through the night 
a toot on your horn, a flash of your brights 
honk if you're lonely tonight. 

i know honky-tonk where we can go. 
a booth in the back with the lights way down low. 
the jukebox is playing a sad melody 
for heart-broken lovers like you and me. 

we'll laugh and we'll flirt and we'll dance every dance 
and before the night's over we'll take a chance. 
the morning will find us with a smile on our face 
and we'll be together in a lover's embrace. 

(chorus) 

i know it seems sad to be so damn blue 
but there's always the chance that you'll meet someone new. 
i know that somewhere waiting for me 
is a sad lonely lover with a bumper that reads:
