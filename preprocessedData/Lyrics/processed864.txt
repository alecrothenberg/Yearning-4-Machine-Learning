generals gathered in their masses,
just like witches at black masses.
evil minds that plot destruction,
sorcerers of death's construction.
in the fields the bodies burning,
as the war machine keeps turning.
death and hatred to mankind,
poisoning their brainwashed minds...oh lord yeah!

politicians hide themselves away
they only started the war
why should they go out to fight?
they leave that role to the poor

time will tell on their power minds
making war just for fun
treating people just like pawns in chess
wait `till their judgement day comes, yeah!

now in darkness, world stops turning,
as you hear the bodies burning.
no more war pigs of the power,
hand of god has struck the hour.
day of judgement, god is calling,
on their knees the war pigs crawling.
begging mercy for their sins,
satan, laughing, spreads his wings...oh lord, yeah!
