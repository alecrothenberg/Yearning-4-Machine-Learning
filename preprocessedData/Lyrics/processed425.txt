well you're my friend
(it's what you told me)
and can you see
(what's inside of me)
many times
we've been out drinking
and many times
we've shared our thoughts
but did you ever, ever notice
the kind of thoughts i got
well you know i have a love
a love for everyone i know
and you know i have a drive
to live i won't let go
but can you see it's opposition
comes a-rising up sometimes
that it's dreadful and position
comes blacking in my mind

and that i see a darkness
and that i see a darkness
and that i see a darkness
and that i see a darkness
and did you know how much i love you
is a hope that somehow you you
can save me from this darkness

well i hope that someday, buddy
we have peace in our lives
together or apart
alone or with our wives
that we can stop our whoring
and pull the smiles inside
and light it up forever
and never go to sleep
my best unbeaten brother
this isn't all i see

oh no i see a darkness
