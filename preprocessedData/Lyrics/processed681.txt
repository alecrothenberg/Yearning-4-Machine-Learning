in the corner 
of my eye 
i saw you in rudy's 
you were very high 
you were high 
it was a cryin' disgrace 
they saw your face 

on the counter 
by your keys 
was a book of numbers 
and your remedies 
one of these 
surely will screen out the sorrow 
but where are you tomorrow

i can't cry anymore 
while you run around 
break away 
just when it 
seems so clear 
that it's 
over now 
drink your big black cow 
and get out of here

down to greene street 
there you go 
lookin' so outrageous 
and they tell you so 
you should know 
how all the pros play the game 
you change your name 

like a gangster 
on the run 
you will stagger homeward 
to your precious one 
i'm the one 
who must make everything right 
talk it out till daylight 

i don't care anymore 
why you run around 
break away 
just when it 
seems so clear 
that it's 
over now 
drink your big black cow 
and get out of here
 in the corner
