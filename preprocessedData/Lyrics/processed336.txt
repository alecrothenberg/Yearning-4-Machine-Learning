ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
i can't stay
yes i know
you know i
hate to go
but goodbye
love was sweet
i was kind
never mean
so i'll cry just a little cause i love you so
and i'll die just a little cause i have to go
away...
can't you see
how i feel
when i say
love's unreal
so goodbye
it's been sweet
even though
incomplete
so i'll cry just a little cause i love you so
and i'll die just a little cause i have to go
away...

[instrumental interlude]

every night
i still hear
oh your sigh's
very near
now it's gone
gone away
as i once
heard you say
now i'll cry just a little cause i love you so
and i'll die just a little cause i have to go
away...
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
 ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
i can't stay
yes i know
