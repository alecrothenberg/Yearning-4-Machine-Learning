ever seen a blind man cross the road
trying to make the other side?
ever seen a young girl growing old
trying to make herself a bride?

so what becomes of you my love
when they have finally stripped you of
the handbags and the gladrags
that your grandad had to sweat so you could buy.
baby

once i was a young man
and all i thought i had to do was smile.
you are still a young girl,
and you bought everything in style.
listen
but once you think you're in you're out
'cause you dont mean a single thing without
the handbags and the gladrags
that your grandad had to sweat so you could buy.

sing a song of six-pence for your sake
and take a bottle full of rye.
four and twenty blackbirds in a cake,
and bake them all in a pie.

they told me you missed school today,
so what i suggest: you just throw them all away,
the handbags and the gladrags
that your poor old granddad had to sweat to buy.
