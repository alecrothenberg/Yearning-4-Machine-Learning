it was long ago
seems like yesterday
saw you standing in the rain
then i heard you say

(chorus)
i want to love but it comes out wrong
i want to live but i don't belong
i close my eyes and i see
blood and roses

love flowers in the springtime
october we were wed
in wintertime the roses died
the blood ran cold
and then she said

(chorus)

it was long ago
seems like yesterday
saw you standing in the rain
then i heard you say

i need your love but it comes out wrong
i try to live but i don't belong
i close my eyes and i see
blood and roses
(fade)
 it was long ago
seems like yesterday
saw you standing in the rain
then i heard you say

(chorus)
i want to love but it comes out wrong
i want to live but i don't belong
i close my eyes and i see
blood and roses

love flowers in the springtime
october we were wed
in wintertime the roses died
the blood ran cold
and then she said

(chorus)

it was long ago
seems like yesterday
saw you standing in the rain
then i heard you say

i need your love but it comes out wrong
i try to live but i don't belong
i close my eyes and i see
blood and roses
(fade)
 it was long ago
seems like yesterday
saw you standing in the rain
then i heard you say

(chorus)
i want to love but it comes out wrong
i want to live but i don't belong
i close my eyes and i see
blood and roses

love flowers in the springtime
october we were wed
in wintertime the roses died
the blood ran cold
and then she said

(chorus)

it was long ago

i need your love but it comes out wrong
i try to live but i don't belong
