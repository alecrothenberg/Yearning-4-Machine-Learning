god, what a mess, on the ladder of success   
where you take one step and miss the whole first rung              
dreams unfulfilled, graduate unskilled         
it beats pickin' cotton and waitin' to be forgotten

we are the sons of no one, bastards of young
we are the sons of no one, bastards of young       
the daughters and the sons

clean your baby womb, trash that baby boom
elvis in the ground, there'll ain't no beer tonight
income tax deduction, what a hell of a function 
it beats pickin' cotton and waitin' to be forgotten

we are the sons of no one, bastards of young
we are the sons of no one, bastards of young
the daughters and the sons

unwillingness to claim us, ya got no word (war?) to name us

the ones who love us best are the ones we'll lay to rest
and visit their graves on holidays at best           
the ones who love us least are the ones we'll die to please
if it's any consolation, i don't begin to understand them

we are the sons of no one, bastards of young
we are the sons of no one, bastards of young
the daughters and the sons

young...take it, it's yours...
