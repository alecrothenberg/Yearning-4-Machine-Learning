dear mister fantasy play us a tune
something to make us all happy
do anything take us out of this gloom
sing a song, play guitar
make it snappy

you are the one who can make us all laugh
but doing that you break out in tears
please don't be sad if it was a straight mind you had
we wouldn't have known you all these years
