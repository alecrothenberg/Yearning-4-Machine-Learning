oh, a storm is threat'ning
my very life today
if i don't get some shelter
oh yeah, i'm gonna fade away
war, children, it's just a shot away
it's just a shot away
war, children, it's just a shot away
it's just a shot away
ooh, see the fire is sweepin'
our very street today
burns like a red coal carpet
mad bull lost your way
war, children, it's just a shot away
it's just a shot away
war, children, it's just a shot away
it's just a shot away
rape, murder!
it's just a shot away

or i'm gonna fade away
war, children, it's just a shot away
it's just a shot away
