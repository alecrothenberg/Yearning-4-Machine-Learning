here's a little song i wrote
you might want to sing it note for note
don't worry, be happy
in every life we have some trouble
but when you worry you make it double
don't worry, be happy
don't worry, be happy now

don't worry, be happy, don't worry, be happy
don't worry, be happy, don't worry, be happy

ain't got no place to lay your head
somebody came and took your bed
don't worry, be happy
the landlord say your rent is late
he may have to litigate
don't worry, be happy
don't worry, be happy

don't worry, be happy, don't worry, be happy
don't worry, be happy, don't worry, be happy
