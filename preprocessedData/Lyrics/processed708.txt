shirley,
it's quite exciting to be sleeping here in this new room
shirley,
you're my reason to get out of bed before noon
shirley,
you know when we sat out on the fire escape talking
shirley,
what did you say about running before we were walking
sometimes when we're as close as this
it's like we're in a dream
how can you lie there and think of england
when you don't even know who's in the team
shirley,
your sexual politics have left me all of a muddle
shirley,
we are joined in the ideological cuddle
i'm celebrating my love for you
with a pint of beer and a new tattoo
and if you haven't noticed yet
i'm more impressionable when my cement is wet
politics and pregnancy
are debated as we empty our glasses
and how i love those evening classes
shirley,
you really know how to make a young man angry
shirley,
can we get through the night without mentioning family
the people from your church agree
it's not much of a career
trying the handles of parked cars
whoops, there goes another year
whoops, there goes another pint of beer
here we are in our summer years
living on icecream and chocolate kisses
would the leaves fall from the trees
if i was your old man and you were my missus 
shirley, 
give my greetings to the new brunette
