i pulled into nazareth, was feeling 'bout half past dead 
i just need some place where i can lay my head 
hey, mister, can you tell me, where a man might find a bed? 
he just grinned and shook my hand, "no" was all he said. 

[chorus]
take a load off fanny, take a load for free 
take a load off fanny, and you put the load right on me 

i picked up my bags, i went looking for a place to hide 
when i saw old carmen and the devil, walking side by side 
i said, "hey, carmen, c'mon, let's go downtown" 
she said, "i gotta go, but my friend can stick around" 

[chorus]

go down, miss moses, ain't nothin' you can say 
it's just old luke, and luke's waiting on the judgment day 
well, luke, my friend, what about young annalee 
he said, "do me a favor, son, won't you stay and keep annalee company" 

[chorus]

crazy chester followed me, and he caught me in the fog 
said, "i will fix your rag, if you'll take jack, my dog" 
i said, "wait a minute chester, you know, i'm a peaceful man" 
he said, "that's ok, boy, won't you feed him when you can" 

[chorus]

catch the cannonball, now to take me down the line 
my bag is sinking low, and i do believe it's time 
to get back to miss fanny, you know she's the only one 
who sent me here, with her regards for everyone
