yeah 
i was working part time in a five-and-dime 
my boss was mr. mcgee 
he told me several times that he didn't like my kind 
cause i was a bit 2 leisurely 
seems that i was busy doing something close 2 nothing 
but different than the day before 
that's when i saw her, ooh, i saw her 
she walked in through the out door, out door 
she wore a 
raspberry beret 
the kind u find in a second hand store 
raspberry beret 
and if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more 
raspberry beret 
i think i love her 
built like she was 
she had the nerve 2 ask me 
if i planned 2 do her any harm 
so, look here 
i put her on the back of my bike 
and-a we went riding 
down by old man johnson's farm 
i said now, overcast days never turned me on 
but something about the clouds and her mixed 
she wasn't 2 bright 
but i could tell when she kissed me 
she knew how 2 get her kicks 
she wore a 
raspberry beret 
the kind u find in a second hand store 
raspberry beret 
and if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more 
raspberry beret 
i think i love her 
the rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof 
and the horses wonder who u are 
thunder drowns out what the lightning sees 
u feel like a movie star 
listen 
they say the first time ain't the greatest 
but i tell ya 
if i had the chance 2 do it all again 
i wouldn't change a stroke 
cause baby i'm the most 
with a girl as fine as she was then 


(raspberry beret) 
the kind u find (the kind u find) 
the kind u find (in a second hand store) 
oh no no 
(raspberry beret) 
(and if it was warm) 
where have all the raspberry women gone? (she wouldn't wear much more)
