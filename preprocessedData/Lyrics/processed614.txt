i was working in the lab late one night 
when my eyes beheld an eerie sight 
for my monster from his slab began to rise 
and suddenly to my surprise 


he did the mash 
he did the monster mash 
the monster mash 
it was a graveyard smash 
he did the mash 
it caught on in a flash 
he did the mash 
he did the monster mash 


from my laboratory in the castle east 
to the master bedroom where the vampires feast 
the ghouls all came from their humble abodes 
to get a jolt from my electrodes 


they did the mash 
they did the monster mash 
the monster mash 
it was a graveyard smash 
they did the mash 
it caught on in a flash 
they did the mash 
they did the monster mash 


the zombies were having fun 
the party had just begun 
the guests included wolf man 
dracula and his son 


the scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds 
igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds 
the coffin-bangers were about to arrive 
with their vocal group, &quot;the crypt-kicker five&quot; 


they played the mash 
they played the monster mash 
the monster mash 
it was a graveyard smash 
they played the mash 
it caught on in a flash 
they played the mash 
they played the monster mash 


out from his coffin, drac's voice did ring 
seems he was troubled by just one thing 
he opened the lid and shook his fist 
and said, &quot;whatever happened to my transylvania twist?&quot; 


it's now the mash 
it's now the monster mash 
the monster mash 
and it's a graveyard smash 
it's now the mash 
it's caught on in a flash 
it's now the mash 
it's now the monster mash 


now everything's cool, drac's a part of the band 
and my monster mash is the hit of the land 
for you, the living, this mash was meant too 
when you get to my door, tell them boris sent you 


then you can mash 
then you can monster mash 
the monster mash 
and do my graveyard smash 
then you can mash 
you'll catch on in a flash 
then you can mash 
then you can monster mash
