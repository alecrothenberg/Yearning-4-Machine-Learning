i changed my name in search of fame
to find the midas touch
oh i wish i'd never wanted then
what i want now twice as much
we crossed the mighty oceans
and we had a few divides
but we never crossed emotion
for we felt too much inside

you know all the tales we tell
you know the band so well
still i feel, somehow, we let you down
we went off somewhere on the way
and now i see we have to pay
the rock'n'roll circus is in town

buffin lost his child-like dreams
and mick lost his guitar
and verden grew a line or two
and overend's just a rock'n'roll star
behind these shades the visions fade
as i learn a thing or two
oh but if i had my time again
you all know just what i'd do

rock'n'roll's a loser's game
it mesmerises and i can't explain
the reasons for the sights and for the sounds
we went off somewhere on the way
and now i see we have to pay
the rock'n'roll circus is in town

so rock'n'roll's a loser's game
it mesmerises and i can't explain
the reasons for the sights and for the sounds
the greasepaint still sticks to my face
so what the hell, i can't erase
the rock'n'roll feeling from my mind

from my mind?.from my mind?.from my mind
