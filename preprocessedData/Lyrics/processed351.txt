on a thousands islands in the sea

see a thousand people just like me

a hundred unions in the snow

?i watch them walking filing in a row

feel it always on the ground

it's gonna be so quiet here tonight

a thousand islands on the sea

it's a shame



a hundred years ago a sailor

trod this ground i stood upon

take me away everyone

when he looks down



from my head to my toes

from the words in this book

see a vision that would bring me luck

from my head to my toes

through my teeth through my nose

you get these words wrong

you get these words wrong

every time

you get these words wrong

i just smile



from my head to my toes

from my knees to my eyes

every time i watch the sky

but for these last few days leave me alone

leave me alone

leave me alone

leave me aloneon a thousands islands in the sea

see a thousand people just like me

a hundred unions in the snow

?i watch them walking filing in a row

feel it always on the ground

it's gonna be so quiet here tonight
