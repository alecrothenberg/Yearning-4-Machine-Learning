punctured bicycle 
on a hillside desolate 
will nature make a man of me yet? 

when in this charming car 
this charming man 

why pamper life's complexity 
when the leather runs smooth 
on the passenger seat? 

i would go out tonight 
but i haven't got a stitch to wear 
this man said "it's gruesome 
that someone so handsome should care"

ah ! a jumped-up pantry boy 
who never knew his place 
he said "return the ring"
he knows so much about these things 
he knows so much about these things 

i would go out tonight 
but i haven't got a stitch to wear 
this man said "it's gruesome 
that someone so handsome should care"
la, la-la, la-la, la-la, this charming man... 
oh, la-la, la-la, la-la, this charming man...
