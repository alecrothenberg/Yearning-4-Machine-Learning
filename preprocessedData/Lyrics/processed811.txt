you say i need a job,
i've got my own business
you want to know what i do?
none of your fucking business
but now i'm lying here
knowing that business had a name,
but now i'm a number
1 2 3 repeater
down by law, i've got this nasty habit
when i need something i reach out and grab it
once upon a time i had a name and a way
but to you i'm nothing but a number
1 2 3 repeater
did you hear something outside?
it sounded like a gun
stay away from that window boy
it's not anyone we know
only about ourselves and what we read in the paper
don't you know ink washes out easier than blood
but we don't have to try it
and we don't have to buy it
