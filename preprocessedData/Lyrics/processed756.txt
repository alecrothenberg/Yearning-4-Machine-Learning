my mother was a witch, she was burned alive
thankless little bitch, for the tears i cried
take her down now, don't wanna see her face
blistered and burnt, can't hide my disgrace

27 every one was nice, gotta see them,
make them pay the price
see their bodies out on the ice, take my time

am i evil, yes i am
am i evil, i am man

as i watched my mother die, i lost my head
revenge now i sought, to break with my bread
takin' no chances, you come with me
i'll split you to the bone
help set you free.

27 every one was nice, gotta see them,
make them pay the price
see their bodies out on the ice, take my time

am i evil, yes i am
am i evil, i am man

on with the action now, i'll strip your pride
i'll spread your blood around, i'll see you ride
your face is scarred with steel, wounds deep and neat
like a double dozen before you, smell so sweet.

27 every one was nice, gotta see them,
make them pay the price
see their bodies out on the ice, take my time

am i evil, yes i am
am i evil, i am man

i'll make my residence, i'll watch your fire
you can come with me, sweet desire
my face is long forgotten, my face not my own
sweet and timely whore, take me home
 my mother was a witch, she was burned alive
thankless little bitch, for the tears i cried
take her down now, don't wanna see her face
blistered and burnt, can't hide my disgrace
