sometimes the world is a valley of heartaches and tears

and in the hustle and bustle, no sunshine appears

but you and i have our love always there to remind us

there is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us

volare, oh, oh! cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!

let's fly way up to the clouds, away from the maddening crowds

we can sing in the glow of a star that i know of

where lovers enjoy peace of mind

let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind

just like birds of a feather a rainbow together we'll find

volare, oh, oh! cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!

no wonder my happy heart sings

your love has given me wings

your love has given me wingssometimes the world is a valley of heartaches and tears

and in the hustle and bustle, no sunshine appears

but you and i have our love always there to remind us

there is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us

volare, oh, oh! cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!

let's fly way up to the clouds, away from the maddening crowds
