headin' for the station with a pack on my back,
i'm tired of transportation in the back of hack,
i love to hear the rhythm of the clickity clack,
and hear the lonesome whistle, see the smoke from the stack,
and pal around with democratic fellows named mac;
so, take me right back to the track, jack!

choo choo, choo choo, ch'boogie!
woo woo, ooh ooh, ch'boogie!
choo choo, choo choo, ch'boogie!
take me right back to the track, jack!

you reach your destination, but alas and alack!
you need some compensation to get back in the black,
you take your morning paper from the top of the stack,
and read the situation from the front to the back,
the only job that's open needs a man with a knack,
so put it right back in the rack, jack!

choo choo, choo choo, ch'boogie!
woo woo, ooh ooh, ch'boogie!
choo choo, choo choo, ch'boogie!
take me right back to the track, jack!

gonna settle down by the railroad track,
live the life of riley in a beaten-down shack,
so when i hear a whistle i can peak through the crack,
and watch the train a rollin' when they're ballin' the jack,
i just love the rhythm of the clickity clack,
so, take me right back to the track, jack!

choo choo, choo choo, ch'boogie!
woo woo, ooh ooh, ch'boogie!
choo choo, choo choo, ch'boogie!
