i took my love, i took it down
climbed a mountain and i turned around
and i saw my reflection in the snow covered hills
'til the landslide brought it down
oh, mirror in the sky
what is love?
can the child within my heart rise above?
can i sail through the changin' ocean tides?
can i handle the seasons of my life?
i don't know

well, i've been afraid of changin'
'cause i've built my life around you
but time makes you bolder
even children get older
and i'm getting older too
oh, take my love, take it down
climb a mountain and turn around

and if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
well the landslide will bring it down
and if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
well the landslide will bring it down
the landslide will bring it down
 i took my love, i took it down
climbed a mountain and i turned around
and i saw my reflection in the snow covered hills
'til the landslide brought it down
oh, mirror in the sky
what is love?
can the child within my heart rise above?
can i sail through the changin' ocean tides?
can i handle the seasons of my life?
i don't know
