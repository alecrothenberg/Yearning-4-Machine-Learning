how lucky can one guy be? 
i kissed her and she kissed me
like the fella once said, 
"ain't that a kick in the head?"
the room was completely black, 
i hugged her and she hugged back
like the sailor said, quote, 
"ain't that a hole in the boat?" 

my head keeps spinnin',
i go to sleep and keep grinnin'
if this is just the beginnin', 
my life is gonna be bee-yoo-tee-ful

i've sunshine enough to spread, 
it's just like the fella said
tell me quick, ain't that a kick in the head?

if this is just the beginnin', 
my life is gonna be bee-yoo-tee-ful

she's tellin' me we'll be wed, 
she's picked out a king-size bed
i couldn't be any better or i'd be sick
tell me quick oh, ain't that a kick?
