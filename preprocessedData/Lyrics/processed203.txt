said it is only a paper moon 
sailing over a cardboard sea, 
but it wouldn't be make believe 
if you believed in me. 

say it is only a canvas sky 
hanging over a muslin tree, 
but it wouldn't be make believe 
if you believed in me. 

without your love, 
it's a honky-tonk parade. 
without your love, 
it's a melody played in a penny arcade. 

it's a barnum and bailey world, 
just as phony as it can be, 
but it wouldn't be make believe 
if you believed in me.
