is it my imagination 
or have i finally found something worth living for? 
i was looking for some action 
but all i found was cigarettes and alcohol 

you could wait for a lifetime 
to spend your days in the sunshine 
you might as well do the white line 
'cause when it comes on top . . . 

you gotta make it happen! 
is it worth the aggravation 
to find yourself a job when there's nothing worth working for? 
it's a crazy situation 

but all i need are cigarettes and alcohol! 
you could wait for a lifetime 
to spend your days in the sunshine 
you might as well do the white line 

'cause when it comes on top... 
you gotta make it happen!
