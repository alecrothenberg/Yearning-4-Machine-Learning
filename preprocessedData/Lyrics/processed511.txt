sweet dreams of you
every night i go through
why can't i forget you and start my life anew
instead of having sweet dreams about you

you don't love me, it's plain
i should know i'll never wear your ring
i should hate you the whole night through
instead of having sweet dreams about you

sweet dreams of you
things i know can't come true
why can't i forget the past, start loving someone new
instead of having sweet dreams about you
 sweet dreams of you
every night i go through
why can't i forget you and start my life anew
instead of having sweet dreams about you

you don't love me, it's plain
i should know i'll never wear your ring
i should hate you the whole night through
instead of having sweet dreams about you

sweet dreams of you
things i know can't come true
why can't i forget the past, start loving someone new
instead of having sweet dreams about you
 sweet dreams of you
every night i go through
why can't i forget you and start my life anew
instead of having sweet dreams about you

you don't love me, it's plain
i should know i'll never wear your ring
i should hate you the whole night through
instead of having sweet dreams about you

sweet dreams of you
