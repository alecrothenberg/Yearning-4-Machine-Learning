do you remember summer days
just after summer rain
when all the air was damp and warm 
in the green of country lanes?
and the breeze would touch your hair
kiss your face and make you care
about your world
your summer world
and we would count the evening stars 
as the day grew dark
in beechwood park...

do you remember golden days and golden summer sun
the sound of laughter in our ears
in the breeze as we would run?
and the breeze would touch your hair
kiss your face and make you care
about your world
your summer world
and we would count the evening stars
as the day grew dark
in beechwood park...

oh roads in my mind
take me back in my mind
and i can't forget you
won't forget you
won't forget those days
and beechwood park...

and the breeze would touch your hair
kiss your face and make you care
about your world
your summer world
and we would count the evening stars
as the day grew dark
in beechwood park...

oh roads in my mind
take me back in my mind
and i can't forget you
won't forget you
won't forget those days
and beechwood park...
