all the leaves are brown
and the sky is grey 
i've been for a walk
on a winter's day
i'd be safe and warm
if i was in l.a.

california dreaming
on such a winter's day

stopped into a church
i passed along the way
well, i got down on my knees
and i pretend to pray
you know the preacher like the cold
he knows i'm gonna stay

all the leaves are brown
and the sky is grey
i've been for a walk
on a winter's day
if  i didn't tell her
i could leave today
 all the leaves are brown
and the sky is grey 
i've been for a walk
on a winter's day
i'd be safe and warm
if i was in l.a.
