sittin' in a restaraunt and she walked by
i seem to recall that certain look in your eye
i said who's that you said with a smile
oh it's nobody, aww nobody
maybe that explains the last two weeks
you call me up dead on your feet
working late again i ask who with
you said nobody, aww nobody

well your nobody called today
she hung up when i asked her name
well i wonder does she think she's being clever (clever)
you say nobody's after you
the fact is what you say is true
but i can love you like nobody can, even better

late last night we went for a drive
you were miles away
i ask who's on your mind
you said nobody (nobody) why do you ask
oh her again, i couldve told you that
we came back home got ready for bed
i said to myself i've got one shot left
your still mine
and i won't stand in line behind nobody, aww nobody

well your nobody called today
she hung up when i asked her name
well i wonder does she think shes being clever (clever)
you say nobody's after you
the fact is what you say is true
but i can love you like nobody can, even better
