don't tell me you don't know what love is 
when you're old enough to know better 
when you find strange hands in your sweater
when your dreamboat turns out to be a footnote 
i'm a man with a mission in two or three editions 
and i'm giving you a longing look 
everyday, everyday, everyday i write the book 

chapter one we didn't really get along 
chapter two i think i fell in love with you 
you said you'd stand by me in the middle of chapter three 
but you were up to your old tricks in chapters four, five and six 

the way you walk 
the way you talk, and try to kiss me, and laugh 
in four or five paragraphs 
all your compliments and your cutting remarks 
are captured here in my quotation marks 

don't tell me you don't know the difference 
between a lover and a fighter 
with my pen and my electric typewriter 
even in a perfect world where everyone was equal 
i'd still own the film rights and be working on the sequel
 don't tell me you don't know what love is 
when you're old enough to know better 
when you find strange hands in your sweater
when your dreamboat turns out to be a footnote 
i'm a man with a mission in two or three editions
