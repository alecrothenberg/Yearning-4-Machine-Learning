well, she was an american girl
raised on promises
she couldn't help thinkin'
that there was a little more to life somewhere else
after all it was a great big world
with lots of places to run to
and if she had to die tryin'
she had one little promise she was gonna keep

o yeah, all right
take it easy, baby
make it last all night
she was an american girl

well it was kind of cold that night,
she stood alone on her balcony
yeah, she could hear the cars roll by,
out on 441 like waves crashin' on the beach
and for one desperate moment
there he crept back in her memory
god it's so painful when something that's so close
is still so far out of reach

o yeah, all right
take it easy, baby
make it last all night
she was an american girl
