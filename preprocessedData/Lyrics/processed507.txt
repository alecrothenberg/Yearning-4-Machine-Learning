in the twilight glow i see
blue eyes crying in the rain
when we kissed goodbye and parted
i knew we'd never meet again

love is like a dying ember
only memories remain
through the ages i'll remember
blue eyes crying in the rain

some day when we meet up yonder
we'll stroll hand in hand again
in a land that knows no parting
blue eyes crying in the rain

now my hair has turned to silver 
all my life i've loved in vain 
i can see her star in heaven 
blue eyes crying in the rain
 in the twilight glow i see
blue eyes crying in the rain
when we kissed goodbye and parted
i knew we'd never meet again

love is like a dying ember
only memories remain
through the ages i'll remember
blue eyes crying in the rain

some day when we meet up yonder
we'll stroll hand in hand again
in a land that knows no parting
blue eyes crying in the rain

now my hair has turned to silver 
all my life i've loved in vain 
i can see her star in heaven 
blue eyes crying in the rain
 in the twilight glow i see
blue eyes crying in the rain
when we kissed goodbye and parted
i knew we'd never meet again

love is like a dying ember
only memories remain
through the ages i'll remember
blue eyes crying in the rain

some day when we meet up yonder
we'll stroll hand in hand again
in a land that knows no parting
blue eyes crying in the rain

now my hair has turned to silver 
all my life i've loved in vain 
i can see her star in heaven 
blue eyes crying in the rain
 in the twilight glow i see
blue eyes crying in the rain
when we kissed goodbye and parted
i knew we'd never meet again

love is like a dying ember
only memories remain
through the ages i'll remember
blue eyes crying in the rain

some day when we meet up yonder
we'll stroll hand in hand again
in a land that knows no parting
blue eyes crying in the rain

now my hair has turned to silver 
all my life i've loved in vain 
i can see her star in heaven 
blue eyes crying in the rain
