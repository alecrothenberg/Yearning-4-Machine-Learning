well in 1941 a happy father had a son
and by 1944 the father walked right out the door
and in '45 the mom and son were still alive
but who could tell in '46 if the two were to survive

well the years were passing quickly, but not fast enough for him
so he closed his eyes through '55, then he opened them up again
when he looked around he saw a clown and the clown seemed very gay
and he set that night to join that circus clown and run away

well he followed every railroad track and every highway sign
and he had a girl in each new town and the towns he left behind
and the open road was the only road he knew
but the color of his dreams was slowly turning into blue

then he met a girl, the kind of girl he wanted all his life
she was soft and kind and good to him, so he took her for his wife
and they got a house not far from town and in a little while
the girl had seen the doctor and she came home with a smile

now in 1961 a happy father had a son
and by 1964 the father walked right out the door
and in '65 the mom and son were still around
but what will happen to the boy when the circus comes to town
