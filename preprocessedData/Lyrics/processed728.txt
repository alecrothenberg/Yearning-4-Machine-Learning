i woke up alarmed 
i didn't know where i was at first 
just that i woke up in your arms 
and almost immediately i felt sorry 
'cause i didn't think this would happen again 
no matter what i could do or say 
just that i didn't think this would happen again 
with or without my best intentions 
and whatever happened to a boyfriend 
the kind of guy who tries to win you over? 
and whatever happened to a boyfriend 
the kind of guy who makes love 'cause he's in it? 

and i want a boyfriend 
i want a boyfriend 
i want all that boring old shit like letters and sodas 
letters and sodas 

you got up out of bed 
you said you had a lot of work to do 
but i heard the rest in your head 
and almost immediately i felt sorry 
'cause i didn't think this would happen again 
no matter what i could do or say 
just that i didn't think this would happen again 
with or without my best intentions 

and i want a boyfriend 
i want a boyfriend 
i want all that stupid old shit like letters and sodas 

and i can feel it in my bones 
i'm gonna spend another year alone 
it's fuck and run, fuck and run 
even when i was seventeen 
fuck and run, fuck and run 
even when i was twelve 

and i can feel it in my bones 
i'm gonna spend my whole life alone 
it's fuck and run, fuck and run 
even when i was seventeen 
fuck and run, fuck and run 
even when i was twelve 

you almost felt bad 
you said that i should call you up 
but i knew much better than that 
and almost immediately you felt sorry 
'cause you didn't think this would happen again 
no matter what you could do or say
