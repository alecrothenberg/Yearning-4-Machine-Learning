baby, do you understand me now.
sometimes i feel a little mad.

but don't you know that no one alive
can always be an angel
when things go wrong i seem to be bad


but i'm just a soul whose intentions are good
oh lord, please don't let me be misunderstood


baby, sometimes i'm so carefree.
with a joy that's hard to hide.

and sometimes it seems that all i have do is worry
then you're bound to see my other side


but i'm just a soul whose intentions are good
oh lord, please don't let me be misunderstood


if i seem edgy, i want you to know
that i never mean to take it out on you

life has it's problems and i get more than my share
and that's one thing i never meant to do
cause i love you

oh, oh baby don't you know i'm human
have thoughts like any other one
sometimes i find myself long regretting 
some foolish thing some simple thing i've done


but i'm just a soul whose intentions are good
oh lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

yes, i'm just a soul whose intentions are good
oh lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
