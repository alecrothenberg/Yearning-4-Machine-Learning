the sky is crying, look at the tears roll down the street
the sky is crying, look at the tears roll down the street
i'm waiting in tears for my baby, and i wonder where can she be?

i saw my baby one morning, and she was walking down the street
i saw my baby one morning, yes she walking on down the street
make me feel so good until my poor heart would skip a beat

i got a bad feeling, my baby, my baby don't love me no more
i got a bad feeling, my baby don't love me no more
now the sky been crying, the tears rolling down my door
 the sky is crying, look at the tears roll down the street
the sky is crying, look at the tears roll down the street
i'm waiting in tears for my baby, and i wonder where can she be?
