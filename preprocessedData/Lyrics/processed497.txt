come
and talk of all the things we did today
here
and laugh about our funny little ways
while we have a few minutes to breathe
then i know that it's time you must leave

but darling be home soon
i couldn't bear to wait an extra minute if you dawdled
my darling be home soon
it's not just these few hours but i've been waiting since i toddled
for the great relief of having you to talk to
and now
a quarter of my life is almost past
i think i've come to see myself at last
and i see that the time spent confused
was the time that i spent without you
and i feel myself in bloom

so darling be home soon
i couldn't bear to wait an extra minute if you dawdled
my darling be home soon
it's not just these few hours but i've been waiting since i toddled
for the great relief of having you to talk to

darling be home soon
i couldn't bear to wait an extra minute if you dawdled
my darling be home soon
it's not just these few hours but i've been waiting since i toddled
for the great relief of having you to talk to

go
and beat your crazy head against the sky
try
and see beyond the houses and your eyes
it's ok to shoot the moon

so darling
my darling be home soon
i couldn't bear to wait an extra minute if you dawdled
