every day, i wake up and pray to jah
and he increases the number of clocks by exactly one
everybody's comin' home for lunch these days
last night there were skinheads on my lawn
take the skinheads bowling
take them bowling
take the skinheads bowling
take them bowling
some people say that bowling alleys got big lanes
some people say that bowling alleys all look the same
there's not a line that goes here that rhymes with anything
i has a dream last night, but i forget what it was
i had a dream last night about you, my friend
i had a dream--i wanted to sleep next to plastic
i had a dream--i wanted to lick your knees
i had a dream--it was about nothing
 every day, i wake up and pray to jah
and he increases the number of clocks by exactly one
everybody's comin' home for lunch these days
last night there were skinheads on my lawn
take the skinheads bowling
take them bowling
take the skinheads bowling
take them bowling
some people say that bowling alleys got big lanes
some people say that bowling alleys all look the same
there's not a line that goes here that rhymes with anything
