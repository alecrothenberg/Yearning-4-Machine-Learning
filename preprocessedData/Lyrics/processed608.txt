travelling in a fried-out kombi
on a hippie trail, head full of zombie
i met a strange lady, she made me nervous
she took me in and gave me breakfast
and she said,

"do you come from a land down under
where women glow and men plunder
can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder
you better run, you better take cover."

buying bread from a man in brussels
he was six foot four and full of muscle
i said, "do you speak-a my language?"
he just smiled and gave me a vegemite sandwich
and he said,

"i come from a land down under
where beer does flow and men chunder
can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder
you better run, you better take cover."

lying in a den in bombay
slack jaw, not much to say
i said to the man, "are you trying to tempt me
because i come from the land of plenty?"
and he said,

"oh! do you come from a land down under (oh yeah yeah)
where women glow and men plunder
can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder
you better run, you better take cover."
