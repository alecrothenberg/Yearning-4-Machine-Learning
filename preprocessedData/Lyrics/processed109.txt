as i walk through
this wicked world
searchin' for light in the darkness of insanity.

i ask myself
is all hope lost?
is there only pain and hatred, and misery?

and each time i feel like this inside,
there's one thing i wanna know:
what's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding? ohhhh
what's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding?

and as i walked on
through troubled times
my spirit gets so downhearted sometimes
so where are the strong
and who are the trusted?
and where is the harmony?
sweet harmony.

'cause each time i feel it slippin' away, just makes me wanna cry.
what's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding? ohhhh
what's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding?


so where are the strong?
and who are the trusted?
and where is the harmony?
sweet harmony.

'cause each time i feel it slippin' away, just makes me wanna cry.
what's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding? ohhhh
