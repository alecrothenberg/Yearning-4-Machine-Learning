(tom petty and david a. stewart)
don't come around here no more
don't come around here no more
whatever you're looking for
hey! don't come around here no more

i've given up, i've given up
i've given up on waiting any longer
i've given up, on this love stronger

i don't feel you any more
you darken my door
whatever you're looking for
hey! don't come around here no more

i've given up, i've given up
i've given up, you tangle my emotions
i've given up, honey please admit it is over

(chorus)

stop walking down my street
who do you expect to met?
whatever you're looking for
hey! don't come around here no more

don't come around here no more
don't come around here no more
whatever you're looking for
hey! don't come around here no more

i've given up, i've given up
i've given up on waiting any longer
i've given up, on this love stronger

i don't feel you any more
you darken my door
whatever you're looking for
hey! don't come around here no more

i've given up, i've given up
i've given up, you tangle my emotions
i've given up, honey please admit it is over
