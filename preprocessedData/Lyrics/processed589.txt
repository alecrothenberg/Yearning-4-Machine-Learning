it's been one week since you looked at me
cocked your head to the side
and said i'm angry
five days since you laughed at me saying 
get that together come back and see me
three days since the living room,
i realized it's all my fault, but couldn't tell you
yesterday you'd forgiven me
but it'll still be two days till i say i'm sorry

hold it now and watch the hoodwink
as i make you stop, think
you'll think you're looking at aquaman
i summon fish to the dish,
although i like the chalet swiss
i like the sushi 
cause it's never touched a frying pan

hot like wasabe when i bust rhymes
big like leann rimes
because i'm all about value
bert kaempfert's got the mad hits
you try to match wits
you try to hold me but i bust through

gonna make a break and take a fake
i'd like a stinkin, achin shake 
i like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavors
gotta see the show,
cause then you'll know
the vertigo is gonna grow
cause it's so dangerous,
you'll have to sign a waiver

how can i help it if i think you're funny when you're mad
trying hard not to smile though i feel bad
i'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
can't understand what i mean?
well, you soon will
i have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
i have a history of taking off my shirt

it's been one week since you looked at me
threw your arms in the air and said you're crazy
five days since you tackled me
i've still got the rug burns on both my knees
it's been three days since the afternoon
you realized it's not my fault not a moment too soon
yesterday you'd forgiven me
and now i sit back and wait till you say you're sorry

chickity china the chinese chicken
you have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin'
watchin x-files with no lights on,
we're dans la maison
i hope the smoking man's in this one
like harrison ford i'm getting frantic
like sting i'm tantric
like snickers, guaranteed to satisfy

like kurosawa i make mad films
okay i don't make films
but if i did they'd have a samurai
gonna get a set of better clubs
gonna find the kind with tiny nubs
just so my irons aren't always flying off the back swing
gotta get in tune with sailor moon
cause that cartoon has got the boom anime babes
that make me think the wrong thing

how can i help it if i think you're funny when you're mad
trying hard not to smile though i feel bad
i'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
can't understand what i mean?
you soon will
i have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
i have a history of losing my shirt

it's been one week since you looked at me
dropped your arms to your sides and said i'm sorry
five days since i laughed at you and said
you just did just what i thought you were gonna do
three days since the living room
we realized we're both to blame, but what could we do?
yesterday you just smiled at me
cause it'll still be two days till we say we're sorry

it'll still be two days till we say we're sorry
it'll still be two days till we say we're sorry
birchmount stadium, home of the robbie
