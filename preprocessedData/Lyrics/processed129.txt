i looked out this morning and the sun was gone 
turned on some music to start my day
i lost myself in a familiar song
i closed my eyes and i slipped away

it's more than a feeling, when i hear that old song they used to play (more than a feeling)
i begin dreaming (more than a feeling)
'til i see marianne walk away
i see my marianne walkin' away

so many people have come and gone
their faces fade as the years go by
yet i still recall as i wander on
as clear as the sun in the summer sky

it's more than a feeling, when i hear that old song they used to play (more than a feeling)
i begin dreaming (more than a feeling)
'til i see marianne walk away
i see my marianne walkin' away

when i'm tired and thinking cold
i hide in my music, forget the day
and dream of a girl i used to know
i closed my eyes and she slipped away
she slipped away. she slipped away. 

it's more than a feeling, when i hear that old song they used to play (more than a feeling)
