well, in north carolina, way back in the hills
me and my old pappy had a hand in a still
we brewed white lightnin' 'til the sun went down
then he'd fill him a jug and he'd pass it around
mighty, mighty pleasin, pappy's corn squeezin'
whshhhoooh . . . white lightnin'.

chorus:
well, the g men, t men, revenuers, too
searchin' for the place where he made his brew
they were looking, tryin to book him,
but my pappy kept a-cookin'
whshhhoooh . . . white lightnin'.

--- instrumental ---

well, i asked my old pappy why he called his brew
white lightnin' 'stead of mountain dew
i took a little sip and right away i knew
as my eyes bugged out and my face turned blue
lightnin' started flashin' and thunder started crashin'
shhhoooh . . . white lightnin'.

chorus:
well, the g men, t men, revenuers, too
searchin' for the place where he made his brew
they were looking, tryin to book him,
but my pappy kept a-cookin'
whshhhoooh . . . white lightnin'.

--- instrumental ---

well, a city slicker came and he said i'm tough
i think i wanna taste that powerful stuff
he took one s-slug and drank it right down
and i heard him a moaning as he hit the ground
mighty, mighty pleasin, pappy's corn squeezin'
whshhhoooh . . . white lightnin'.

chorus:
well, the g men, t men, revenuers, too
searchin' for the place where he made his brew
they were looking, tryin to book him,
but my pappy kept a-cookin'
whshhhoooh . . . white lightnin'...
