you wanna graduate but not in 'is bed
here's what you gotta do -
pick up the phone

i lead a life of crime
dirty deeds done dirt cheap
[repeat x3]

you got a broken heart
he's double dealin' with your best friend
that's when the teardrops start -
pick up the phone
i'm here alone
or make a social call

forget about him
we'll have ourselves a ball
dirty deeds done dirt cheap
[repeat x3]

if you got a lady but you want her gone
but you ain't got the guts

your back door man
dirty deeds done dirt cheap
[repeat x3]
