i don't believe in frettin' and grievin';
why mess around with strife?
i never was cut out to step and strut out.
give me the simple life.

some find it pleasant dining on pheasant.
those things roll off my knife;
just serve me tomatoes; and mashed potatoes;
give me the simple life.

a cottage small is all i'm after,
not one that's spacious and wide.
a house that rings with joy and laughter
and the ones you love inside.

some like the high road, i like the low road,
free from the care and strife.
sounds corny and seedy, but yes, indeed-y;
give me the simple life.
