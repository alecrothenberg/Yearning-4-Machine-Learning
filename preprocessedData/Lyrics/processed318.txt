when you're alone and life is making you lonely
you can always go - downtown
when you've got worries, all the noise and the hurry
seems to help, i know - downtown
just listen to the music of the traffic in the city
linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty
how can you lose?

the lights are much brighter there
you can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
so go downtown, things'll be great when you're
downtown - no finer place, for sure
downtown - everything's waiting for you

don't hang around and let your problems surround you
there are movie shows - downtown
maybe you know some little places to go to
where they never close - downtown
just listen to the rhythm of a gentle bossa nova
you'll be dancing with him too before the night is over
happy again

the lights are much brighter there
you can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
so go downtown, where all the lights are bright
downtown - waiting for you tonight
downtown - you're gonna be all right now

[instrumental break]

and you may find somebody kind to help and understand you
someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to
guide them along

so maybe i'll see you there
we can forget all our troubles, forget all our cares
so go downtown, things'll be great when you're
downtown - don't wait a minute for
downtown - everything's waiting for you

downtown, downtown, downtown, downtown ...
 when you're alone and life is making you lonely
you can always go - downtown
