back in the garage with my bullshit detector
carbon monoxide making sure it's effective
people ringing up making offers for my life
but i just want to stay in the garage all night

we're a garage band
we come from garageland

meanwhile things are hotting up in the west end alright
contracts in the offices, groups in the night
my bummin' slummin' friends have all got new boots
an' someone just asked me if the group would wear suits

i don't want to hear about what the rich are doing
i don't want to go to where the rich are going
they think they're so clever, they think they're so right
but the truth is only known by guttersnipes

there's twenty-two singers! but one microphone
back in the garage
there's five guitar players! but one guitar
back in the garage
complaints! complaints! wot an old bag
back in the garage
all night
