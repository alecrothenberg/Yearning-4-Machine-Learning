        not quittin' though
        signed the hard rhymer
        work to keep from gettin' jerked
        changin' some ways
        to way back in the better days
        raw metaphysically bold
        never followed a code
        still dropped a load
        never question what i am god knows
        cause it's comin' from the heart
        what i got better get some

        now i can't protect a pad off defect
        check the record
        an reckon an intentional wreck
        played off as some intellect
        made the call, took the fall
        broke the laws
        not my fault they're fallin' off
        known as fair square
        throughout my years
        so i growl at the livin' foul
        black to the bone my home is your home
        so welcome to the terrordome
        subordinate terror
        kickin' off an era
        cold deliverin' pain
        my 98 was 87 on a record yo
        so now i go bronco

        crucifixion ain't no fiction
        so called chosen frozen
        apology made to who ever pleases
        still they got me like jesus
        i rather sing, bring, think reminisce
        'bout a brother while i'm in sync
        every brother ain't a brother cause a color
        just as well could be undercover
        backstabbed, grabbed a flag
        from the back of the lab
        told a rab get off the rag
        sad to say i got sold down the river
        still some quiver when i deliver
        never to say i never know or had a clue
        word was heard, plus hard on the boulevard
        lies, scandalizin', basin'
        traits of hate who's celebratin' wit satan?
        i rope a dope the evil with righteous
        bobbin' and weavin' and let the good get even
        c'mon down
        and welcome to the terrordome.
        caught in the race against time
        the pit and the pendulum
        check the rhythm and rhymes
        while i'm bendin' 'em
        snakes blowin' up the lines of design
        tryin' to blind the science i'm snedin' 'em
        how to fight the power
        cannot run and hide
        but it shouldn't be suicide
        in a game a fool without the rules
        got a hell of a nerve to just criticize
        every brother ain't a brother
        cause a black hand
        squeezed on malcom x the man
        the shootin' of huey newton
        from a hand of a nigger who pulled the trigger

        it's weak to speak and blame somebody else
        when you destroy yourself
        first nothing's worse than a mother's pain
        of a son slain in bensonhurst
        can't wait for the state to decide the fate
        so this jam i dedicate
        places with racist faces
        just an example of one of many cases
        the greek weekend speech i speak
        from a lesson learned in virginia (beach)
        i don't smile in the line of fire
        i go wildin'
        but it's on bass and drums even violins
        watcha do gitcha head ready
        instead of gettin' physically sweaty
        when i get mad
        i put it down on a pad
        give ya somethin' that cha never had controllin'
        fear of high rollin'
        god bless your soul and keep livin'
        never allowed, kickin' it loud
        droppin' a bomb
        brain game intellectual vietnam
        move as a team
        never move alone
