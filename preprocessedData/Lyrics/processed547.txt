nights in white satin, never reaching the end,
letters i've written, never meaning to send.
beauty i'd always missed with these eyes before.
just what the truth is, i can't say anymore.

'cos i love you, yes i love you, oh how i love you.

gazing at people, some hand in hand,
just what i'm going through they can't understand.
some try to tell me, thoughts they cannot defend,
just what you want to be, you will be in the end.

and i love you, yes i love you,
oh how i love you, oh how i love you.

oh how i love you, oh how i love you.
'cos i love you, yes i love you,
oh how i love you, oh how i love you.

breath deep 
the gathering gloom
watch lights fade 
from every room
bedsitter people 
look back and lament
another day's useless 
energy spent

impassioned lovers
wrestle as one 
lonely man cries for love
and has none
new mother picks up 
and suckles her son
senior citizens 
wish they were young

cold hearted orb
that rules the night
removes the colours
from our sight
red is gray and 
yellow white
but we decide
which is right 
and 
which is an illusion
