sometimes i wonder why i spend
the lonely nights
dreaming of a song.
the melody haunts my reverie
and i am once again with you.
when our love was new, and each kiss an inspiration.
but that was long ago, and now my consolation
is in the stardust of a song.
beside the garden wall, when stars are bright
you are in my arms
the nightingale tells his fairy tale
of paradise where roses grew.
though i dream in vain, in my heart you will remain
my stardust melody
the memory of loves refrain.
