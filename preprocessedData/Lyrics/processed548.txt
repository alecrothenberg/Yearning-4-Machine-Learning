all alone at the end of the evening
and the bright lights have faded to blue
i was thinking 'bout a woman who might have
loved me and i never knew
you know i've always been a dreamer
(spent my life running 'round)
and it's so hard to change
(can't seem to settle down)
but the dreams i've seen lately
keep on turning out and burning out
and turning out the same.

so put me on a highway
and show me a sign
and take it to the limit one more time.

you can spend all your time making money
you can spend all your love making time
if it all fell to pieces tomorrow
would you still be mine?

and when you're looking for your freedom
(nobody seems to care)
and you can't find the door
(can't find it anywhere)
when there's nothing to believe in
still you're coming back, you're running back
you're coming back for more.

so put me on a highway
and show me a sign
and take it to the limit one more time.

take it to the limit
take it to the limit
take it to the limit one more time.

take it to the limit
take it to the limit
take it to the limit one more time.

take it to the limit
take it to the limit

take it to the limit

take it to the limit
take it to the limit
