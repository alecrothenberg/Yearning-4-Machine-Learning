i hear the clock, it's 6am
i feel so far from where i've been
i got my eggs and i've got my pancakes too
i got my maple syrup, everything but you
i break the yolks and make a smiley face
i kinda like it in my brand new place
wipe the spots off all the mirror
don't leave the keys in the door
i never put wet towels on the floor anymore

cause…
dreams last so long
even after you're gone
i know, that you love me
and soon you will see
you were meant for me
and i was meant for you

i called my momma, she was out for a walk
consoled a cup of coffee but it didn't wanna talk
so i picked up a paper, it was more bad news
more hearts being broken and more people being used
put on my coat in the pouring rain
i saw a movie but it just wasn't the same
cause it was happy or i was sad
and it made me miss you oh so bad

cause…
dreams last so long
even after you're gone
i know, that you love me
and soon you will see
you were meant for me
and i was meant for you

i go about my business, i'm doing fine
besides, what would i say if i had you on the line
same old story, not much to say
hearts are broken every day

i brush my teeth and put the cap back on
i know you hate it when i leave the light on
i pick a book up, and then i turn the sheets down
and then i take a deep breath and a good look around
put on my pj's and hop into bed
i'm half alive but i feel mostly dead
i try and tell myself it will be all right
i just shouldn't think anymore tonight

cause…
dreams last so long
even after you're gone
and i know, you love me
and soon i know you will see
you were meant for me
and i was meant for you
yeah, you were meant for me
and i was meant for youi hear the clock, it's 6am
i feel so far from where i've been
i got my eggs and i've got my pancakes too
i got my maple syrup, everything but you
