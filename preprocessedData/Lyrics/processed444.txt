two jumps and a week
i bet you think that's pretty clever, don't you boy
flying on your motorcycle
watching all the ground beneath you drop

kill yourself for recognition
kill yourself to never ever stop
you broke another mirror
you're turning into something you are not

don't leave me high, don't leave me dry
don't leave me high, don't leave me dry

drying up in conversation 
you will be the one who cannot talk
all your insides fall to pieces
you just sit there wishing you could still make love

they're the ones who'll hate you 
when you think you've got the world all sussed out
they're the once who'll spit at you
you'll be the one screaming out

don't leave me high, don't leave me dry
don't leave me high, don't leave me dry

it's the best thing that you ever had, 
the best thing you ever, ever had
it's the best thing that you ever had, 
the best thing you have had is gone away

don't leave me high, don't leave me dry (x4)
