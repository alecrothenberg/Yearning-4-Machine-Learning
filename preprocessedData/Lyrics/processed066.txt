backstroke lover always hidin' 'neath the covers
till i talked to your daddy, he say
he said "you ain't seen nothin' till you're down on a muffin
then you're sure to be a-changin' your ways"
i met a cheerleader, was a real young bleeder
oh, the times i could reminisce
'cause the best things of lovin' with her sister and her cousin
only started with a little kiss
like this!

seesaw swingin' with the boys in the school
and your feet flyin' up in the air
singin' "hey diddle diddle"
with your kitty in the middle of the swing
like you didn't care
so i took a big chance at the high school dance
with a missy who was ready to play
wasn't me she was foolin'
'cause she knew what she was doin'
and i knowed love was here to stay
when she told me to

walk this way [8x]
just gimme a kiss
like this!

schoolgirl sweetie with a classy kinda sassy
little skirt's climbin' way up the knee
there was three young ladies in the school gym locker
when i noticed they was lookin' at me
i was a high school loser, never made it with a lady
till the boys told me somethin' i missed
then my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
so i gave her just a little kiss
like this!

[repeat second verse, substitute this at the end]
when she told me how to walk this way, she told me to

walk this way [8x]
just gimme a kiss
