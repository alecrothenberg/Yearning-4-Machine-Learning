last night i sat my baby right down 
and said the talk's all round the town 
you're cheatin' while i work all day 
i guess that feelin's finally gone 
and i got so tired of spendin' my nights alone 
so i packed my bags and i'm goin' away 

but i sure would hate to lose your lovin' don't you know 
if you said good-bye it just wouldn't feel right some how 
'cause it felt so good 
whole lot better than i thought it could 
honey i hate to lose you now 

well i swore i wouldn't sit and cry 
'cause my baby left me both high and dry 
wouldn't sit and pine gonna move on down the line 
well i knew just what i had to do 
had to find me some love that's new 
'cause lovin's so easy to find 

but i sure would hate to lose that lovin' don't you know 
if you said good-bye it just wouldn't feel right some how 
'cause it felt so good 
whole lot better than i thought it could 
honey i hate to lose you now 

but i think it's gonna be all right 
'cause i found a little girl last night 
and she said you better just move on in 
'cause i got my rent paid through next week and i'll be out tonight 
but don't ya know i'll do my best to be back by ten 

i sure would hate to lose that lovin' don't you know 
if you said good-bye it just wouldn't feel right some how 
'cause it felt so good 
whole lot better than i thought it could 
honey i hate to lose you now 
don't you know 
honey i hate to lose you now 
tryin to tell you
