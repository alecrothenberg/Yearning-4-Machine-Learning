don't don't don't let's start
this is the worst part
could believe for all the world
that you're my precious little girl
but don't don't don't let's start
i've got a weak heart
and i don't get around how you get around

when you are alone you are the cat, you are the phone
you are an animal
the words i'm singing now
mean nothing more than meow to an animal
wake up and smell the cat food in your bank account
but don't try to stop the tail that wags the hound

d, world destruction
over and overture
n, do i need
apostrophe t, need this torture?

don't don't don't let's start
this is the worst part
could believe for all the world
that you're my precious little girl
but don't don't don't let's start
i've got a weak heart
and i don't get around how you get around

no one in the world ever gets what they want and that is beautiful
everybody dies frustrated and sad and that is beautiful
they want what they're not and i wish they would stop saying,
