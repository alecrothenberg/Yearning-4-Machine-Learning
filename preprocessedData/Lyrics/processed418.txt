the ashtray says
you were up all night
when you went to bed
with your darkest mind
your pillow wept
and covered your eyes
and you finally slept
while the sun caught fire

you've changed

we fell in love
in the key of see
we walked along
down by the sea
you followed me down
the neck to d
and fell again
into the sea

you changed
oh, you've changed

maybe all i need is a shot in the arm
maybe all i need is a shot in the arm
maybe all i need is a shot in the arm
maybe all i need is a shot in the arm
maybe all i need is a shot in the arm
maybe all i need is a shot in the arm
maybe all i need is a shot in the arm
something in my veins bloodier than blood
something in my veins bloodier than blood
something in my veins bloodier than blood
something in my veins bloodier than blood

the ashtray says
you were up all night

what you once were isn't what you want to be any more
