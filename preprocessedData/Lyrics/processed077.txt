one, two
born under a bad sign
i been down since i begin to crawl
if it wasn't for bad luck, i wouldn't have no luck at all

hard luck and trouble is my only friend
i been on my own ever since i was ten
born under a bad sign
i been down since i begin to crawl
if it wasn't for bad luck, i wouldn't have no luck at all

i can't read, haven't learned how to write
my whole life has been one big fight
born under a bad sign
i been down since i begin to crawl
if it wasn't for bad luck, i wouldn't have no luck at all

i ain't lyin'
if it wasn't for bad luck i wouldn't have no kind-a luck
if it wasn't for real bad luck, i wouldn't have no luck at all

wine and women is all i crave
a big legged woman is gonna carry me to my grave
born under a bad sign
i been down since i begin to crawl
if it wasn't for bad luck, i wouldn't have no luck at all

yeah, my bad luck boy
been havin' bad luck all of my days, yes
