fox in the snow, where do you go
to find something you can eat?
cause the word out on the street is you are starving
don't let yourself grow hungry now
don't let yourself grow cold
fox in the snow
girl in the snow, where will you go
to find someone that will do?
to tell someone all the truth before it kills you
they listen to your crazy laugh
before you hang a right
and disappear from sight
what do they know anyway?
you'll read it in a book
what do they know anyway?
you'll read it in a book tonight

boy on the bike, what are you like
as you cycle round the town?
you're going up, you're going down
you're going nowhere
it's not as if they're paying you
it's not as if it's fun
at least not anymore
when your legs are black and blue
it's time to take a break
when your legs are black and blue
it's time to take a holiday

kid in the snow, way to go
it only happens once a year
it only happens once a lifetime
make the most of it
second just to being born
second to dying to
what else could you do?
