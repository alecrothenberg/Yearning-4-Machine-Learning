i'll be there in an hour
take at least two weeks there on foot
watering hole, crummy water tower
(???) scream all over if i could
i'll be sad in heaven, you won't visit me there

jesus rides beside me
never buys any smokes
hurry up, hurry up
i've had enough of that stuff
ashtray floor, dirty clothes, filthy jokes

lights flash in the evening
guess we'll follow him there

i'll be there in an hour
if there's a hole in the gate
climb to the top of this crummy water tower screamin'
i can't hardly wait
i can't wait
i can't wait
i can't wait
i can't wait
i can't wait
wait
i can't wait
