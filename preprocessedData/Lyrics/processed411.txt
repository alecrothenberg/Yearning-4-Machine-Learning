i'm the man in the box 
buried in my shit 
won't you come and save me
save me

[chorus:]
feed my eyes, can you sew them shut?
jesus christ, deny your maker 
he who tries, will be wasted 
feed my eyes now you've sewn them shut
 
i'm the dog who gets beat 
shove my nose in shit
won't you come and save me
save me

[chorus: repeat x2]
 i'm the man in the box 
buried in my shit 
won't you come and save me
save me

[chorus:]
feed my eyes, can you sew them shut?
jesus christ, deny your maker 
he who tries, will be wasted 
feed my eyes now you've sewn them shut
 
i'm the dog who gets beat 
shove my nose in shit
won't you come and save me
save me

[chorus: repeat x2]
 i'm the man in the box 
buried in my shit 
won't you come and save me
save me

[chorus:]
feed my eyes, can you sew them shut?
jesus christ, deny your maker 
he who tries, will be wasted 
feed my eyes now you've sewn them shut
 
i'm the dog who gets beat 
shove my nose in shit
won't you come and save me
save me

[chorus: repeat x2]
 i'm the man in the box 
buried in my shit 
won't you come and save me
save me

[chorus:]
feed my eyes, can you sew them shut?
jesus christ, deny your maker 
he who tries, will be wasted 
feed my eyes now you've sewn them shut
 
i'm the dog who gets beat 
shove my nose in shit
won't you come and save me
save me
