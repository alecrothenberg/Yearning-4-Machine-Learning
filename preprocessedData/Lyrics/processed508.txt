hello it's me,
i've thought about us for a long, long time,
maybe i think too much but something's wrong,
there's something here that doesn't last too long,
maybe i shouldn't think of you as mine.
 
seeing you, or seeing anything as much as i do,
i take for granted that you're always there,
i take for granted that you just don't care,
sometimes i can't help seeing all the way through.
 
it's important to me 
that you know you are free,
'cause i never want to make you change for me.
think of me,
you know that i'd be with you if i could
i'll come around to see you once in a while
or if i ever need a reason to smile
and spend the night if you think i should.
