i was happy in the haze of a drunken hour 
but heaven knows i'm miserable now 

i was looking for a job, and then i found a job 
and heaven knows i'm miserable now 

in my life 
why do i give valuable time 
to people who don't care if i live or die? 

two lovers entwined pass me by 
and heaven knows i'm miserable now 

i was looking for a job, and then i found a job 
and heaven knows i'm miserable now 

in my life 
oh, why do i give valuable time 
to people who don't care if i live or die? 

what she asked of me at the end of the day 
caligula would have blushed 

"you've been in the house too long" she said
and i (naturally) fled 

in my life 
why do i smile 
at people who i'd much rather kick in the eye?
