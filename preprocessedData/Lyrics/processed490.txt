i was all right for a while, i could smile for a while
but i saw you last night, you held my hand so tight
as you stopped to say "hello"
aw you wished me well, you couldn't tell

that i'd been crying over you, crying over you
then you said "so long". left me standing all alone
alone and crying, crying, crying crying
it's hard to understand but the touch of your hand
can start me crying

i thought that i was over you but it's true, so true
i love you even more than i did before but darling what can i do
for you don't love me and i'll always be

crying over you, crying over you
yes, now you're gone and from this moment on
i'll be crying, crying, crying, crying
yeah crying, crying, over you
 i was all right for a while, i could smile for a while
