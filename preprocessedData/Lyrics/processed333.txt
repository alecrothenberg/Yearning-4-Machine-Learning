this old man i've talked about
broke his own heart,
poured it in the ground 
big red tree grew up and out,
throws up its leaves,
spins round and round. 

i know all this and more
so take your hat off
when you're talking to me
and be there when i feed the tree 

this little squirrel i used to be
slammed her bike down the stairs
they put silver where her teeth had been
baby silvertooth, she grins and grins


i know all this and more
so take your hat off boy
when you're talking to me
and be there when i feed the tree 

take your hat off boy
when you're talking to me
and be there when i feed the tree 

this old man i used to be
spins around, around, around the tree
silver baby come to me
i'll only hurt you in my dreams 

i know all this and...
