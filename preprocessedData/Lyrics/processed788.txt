yes - the rhythm, the rebel
without a pause - i'm lowering my level
the hard rhymer - where you never been i'm in
you want stylin' - you know it's time again
d the enemy - tellin you to hear it
they praised the music - this time they play the lyrics
some say no to the album, the show
bum rush the sound i made a year ago
i guess you know - you guess i'm just a radical
not a sabbatical - yes to make it critical
the only part your body should be parting to
panther power on the hour from the rebel to you

radio - suckers never play me
on the mix - just o.k. me
now known and grown when they're clocking my zone it's known
snakin' and takin' everything that a brother owns
hard - my calling card
recorded and orderd - supporter of chesimard
loud and proud kickin' live next poet supreme
loop a troop, bazooka, the scheme
flavor - a rebel in his own mind
supporter of my rhyme
designed to scatter a line of suckers who claim i do crime

terminator x

from a rebel it's final on black vinyl
soul, rock and roll comin' like a rhino
tables turn - suckers burn to learn
they can't dis-able the power of my label
def jam - tells you who i am
the enemy's public - they really give a damn
strong island - where i got 'em wild and
that's the reason they're claimin' that i'm violent
never silent - no dope gettin' dumb nope
claimin' where we get our rhythm from
number one - we hit ya and we give ya some
no gun - and still never on the run
you wanna be an s.1 - griff will tell you when
and then you'll come - you'll know what time it is
impeach the president - pullin' out the ray-gun
zap the next one - i could be you're sho-gun
suckers - don't last a minute
soft and smooth - i ain't with it
hardcore - rawbone like a razor
i'm like a lazer - i just won't graze ya
old enough to raise ya - so this will faze ya
get it right boy and maybe i will praise ya
playin' the role i got soul too
voice my opinion with volume
smooth - no what i am
rough - cause i'm the man

no matter what the name - we're all the same
pieces in one big chess game
yeah - the voice of power
is in the house - go take a shower boy
p.e. a group, a crew - not singular
we were black wranglers
we're rap stranglers
you can't angle us - i know you're listenin'
i caught you pissin' in you're pants
you're scared of us dissin' us
the crowd is missin' us
we're on a mission boy

terminator x

attitude - when i'm on fire
juice on the loose - electric wire
simple and plain - give me the lane
i'll throw it down your throat like barkley
see the car keys - you'll never get these
they belong to the 98 posse
you want some more son - you wanna get some
rush the door on a store - pick up the album
you know the rhythm, the rhyme plus the beat is designed
so i can enter your mind - boys
bring the noise - my time
step aside for the flex - terminator xyes - the rhythm, the rebel
without a pause - i'm lowering my level

you want stylin' - you know it's time again
