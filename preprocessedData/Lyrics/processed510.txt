we can't play this game anymore, but
can we still be friends?
things just can't go on like before, but
can we still be friends?

we had something to learn
now it's time for the wheel to turn
things are said one by one
before you know it's all gone

let's admit we made a mistake, but
can we still be friends?
heartbreak's never easy to take, but
can we still be friends?

it's a strange sad affair
sometimes seems like we just don't care
don't waste time feeling hurt
we've been through hell together

la la la la, la la la la
can we still be friends?
can we still get together sometime?

we awoke from our dream
things are not always what they seem
memories linger on
it's like a sweet sad old song
 we can't play this game anymore, but
can we still be friends?
things just can't go on like before, but
can we still be friends?
