it never used to be that bad
but neither was it great
somewhere in the middle than
content and much too safe
ooh tell me please
why it takes so long
to realise when there's something wrong

well lay me out with your heart
now we're gettin' somewhere
push me back to the start
now we're gettin' someplace
take me out let me breathe
now we're gettin' somewhere
when i'm with you i don't care
where it is i'm falling

there's money in the bible belt
hugs for daddy too
three wishes for eternity
we've got some work to do
ooh tell me please, why it takes so long
i believe there is something wrong

well lay me out with your heart
now we're gettin' somewhere
push me back to the start
now we're gettin' someplace
take me out let me breathe
now we're gettin' somewhere
when i'm with you i don't care
where it is i'm falling

(bridge)

ooh tell me please, tell what went wrong
cos i believe there is something wrong

whoa lay me out
now we're gettin' somewhere
push me back
now we're gettin' somewhere
take me out let me breathe
now we're gettin' somewhere
when i'm with you i don't care
where it is i'm falling

when you took me to your room
i swear i said surrender
ooh when you opened up your mouth
i saw the words fall out
though nothing much has changed
i swear i will surrender
and there is pain in my heart
we can choose what we choose to believe
 it never used to be that bad
but neither was it great
somewhere in the middle than
content and much too safe
ooh tell me please
