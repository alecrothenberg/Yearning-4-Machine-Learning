catching the westbound number nine 
gonna leave this town, leave it far behind 
gonna leave while i've got my peace of mind 
on the westbound number nine 

sittin' on the bank of holy creek down by the county line 
i can hear the sound of old boss and lazy horse--he's howlin' right on time 
he's howlin' at the sound of the #9 comin' down the line 
and my mind catches a ride on the westbound number nine 
and my mind catches a ride on the westbound number nine 

catching the westbound number nine 
gonna leave this town, leave it far behind 
gonna leave while i've got my peace of mind 
on the westbound number nine 

my pa is with his moonshine friends 
drinkin deacon jones' bathtub gin 
deacon jones preachin' about savin' souls 
yellin' out how the whole town is full of sin 
but like pa and all the rest 

he tries to look down bobbie sue's low-cut dress 
and my mind catches a ride on the westbound number nine 
and my mind catches a ride on the westbound number nine 

ma, i see you're ashamed to look me in the face 
as if i was nothing but a past mistake 
sittin' there at night when pa comes stumblin' in 
full of the deacon's bathtub gin 
swearin' and a-cussin' that i wasn't no kin 
i heard his name but ma knows what he should have been 

westbound number nine 
gonna leave this town, leave it far behind

catching the westbound number nine
