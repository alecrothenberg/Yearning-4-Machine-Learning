whatever 
dre just let it run 
ah-yo turn the beat up a little bit 
ah-yo  this song is for anyone 
fuck it just shut up and listen 

ah-yo 
i sit back with this pack of zigzags 
and this bag of this weed 
it gives me the shit needed to be 

the most meanest mc on this   on this earth 
'cause since birth i've been cursed with this curse to just curse 
and just blurt this bezerk and bizarre shit that works 
and it sells and it helps in its self 

to relieve all this tension dispensing me 
sentence is getting it, stress has been eating me recently 
off my chest and i rest to get peacefully 
but at least have the decency in you to leave me alone 

when you freaks see me out in the streets when i'm eating or feedin' my daughter 
to not come and speak to me 
i don't know you and no i don't owe you a motherfuck anything 
i'm not mr. nsync and i'm not what your friends think 

i'm not mr. friendly 
i can be a prick, if you tempt me my tank is on empty 
no patience is in me and if you offend me i'm lifting you ten feet 
in the air, i don't care who was there and who saw me destroy you 

go call you a lawyer file you a lawsuit 
i'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe 
i'm tired of all you - i don't mean to be mean but it's all i can be 
it's just me 

[chorus]
and i am 
whatever you say i am 
if i wasn't, then why would i say i am? 
in the papers, the news, everyday i am 
radio won't even play my jam 
'cause i am 
whatever you say i am 
if i wasn't, then why would i say i am? 
in the papers, the news, everyday i am 
i don't know it's just the way i am 

sometimes i just feel like my father, i hate to be bothered 
with all of this nonsense it's constant 
and "oh it's his lyrical content!" 
the song "guilty conscience" has gotten such rotten responses 

and all of this controversy circles me 
and it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me 
so i point one back at 'em 
but not the index or the pinky or the ring or the thumb 

it's the one you put up when you don't give a fuck 
when you won't just put up with the bullshit they pull 
'cause they full of shit too 
when a dude's gettin bullied and shoots up his school 

and they blame it on marilyn - and the heroin 
where were the parents at? 
and look at where it's at middle america 
now it's a tragedy 

now it's so sad to see 
an upper class city having this happening 
then attack eminem cause i rap this way 
but i'm glad cause they feed me the fuel 
that i need for the fire to burn and it's burnin' and i have returned 

[chorus]

i'm so sick and tired of being admired 
that i wish that i would just die or get fired 
and drop from my label and stop with the fables 
i'm not gonna be able to top on "my name is" 

and pigeon holdin' to some poppy sensations 
they cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations 
and i just do not have the patience 
to deal with these cocky caucasians 

who think i'm some wigga who just tries to be black 
'cause i talk with an accent and grab on my balls 
so they always keep asking the same fucking questions 
what school did i go to? 

what hood i grew up in? 
the why? the who, what? 
when and where and the how? 
'til i'm grabbing my hair and i'm tearing it out 

you've been driving me crazy, i can't take it 
i'm racing, i'm pacing, i stand and i sit 
and i'm thankful for every fan that i get 
but i can't take a shit in the bathroom 

without someone standing by it 
no i won't sign your autograph 
you can call me an asshole 
i'm glad cause 

[chorus]
