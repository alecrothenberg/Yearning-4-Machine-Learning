chewing on a piece of grass
walking down the road
tell me, how long you gonna stay here joe?
some people say this town don't look 
good in snow
you don't care, i know

ventura highway in the sunshine
where the days are longer 
the nights are stronger
than moonshine 
you're gonna go i know

'cause the free wind is blowin' through
your hair
and the days surround your daylight 
there
seasons crying no despair
alligator lizards in the air

wishin' on a falling star
watchin' for the early train
sorry boy, but i've been hit by
purple rain
aw, come on joe, you can always
change your name 
thanks a lot son, just the same
