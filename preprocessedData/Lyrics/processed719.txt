mirror, mirror on the wall 
tell me, mirror, what is wrong? 
can it be my de la clothes 
or is it just my de la song? 
what i do ain't make-believe 
people say i sit and try 
but when it comes to being de la 
it's just me myself and i 

it's just me myself and i 
it's just me myself and i 
it's just me myself and i 

now you tease my plug one style 
and my plug one spectacles 
you say plug one and two are hippies 
no, we're not, that's pure plug bull 
always pushing that we've formed an image 
there's no need to lie 
when it comes to being plug one 
it's just me myself and i 

it's just me myself and i 
it's just me myself and i 
it's just me myself and i 

proud, i'm proud of what i am 
poems i speak are plug two type 
please oh please let plug two be 
himself, not what you read or write 
right is wrong when hype is written 
on the soul, de la that is, 
style is surely our own thing 
not the false disguise of showbiz 
de la soul is from the soul 
and this fact i can't deny 
strictly from the dan called stuckie 
and from me myself and i 

it's just me myself and i 
it's just me myself and i 
it's just me myself and i 

glory, glory hallelujah
glory for plugs one and two 
but that glory's been denied 
by kizids and dookie eyes 
people think they dis my person 
by stating i'm darkly pack 
i know this so i point at q-tip 
and he states, 'black is black' 
mirror mirror on the wall, 
shovel chestnuts in my path 
please keep on up with the nuts 
so i don't get in aftermath 
but if i do i'll calmly punch them 
in the fourth day of july 
'cause they tried to mess with 
third degree, that's me myself and i 

it's just me myself and i 
it's just me myself and i 
it's just me myself and i
