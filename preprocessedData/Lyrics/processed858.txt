the lights exploded 
she stood burning in front of me 
she ripped my heart out and gave it to me 
my eyes wouldn't open, cemented to her face 
have i begun a feeble chase? 
i'll be down, i'll be around 
i'll be hanging where eventually you'll have to be 
i'll just stare and hope you'll care 
it's only everything standing in front of me 

i know what you did to me 
i know what you did was wrong 
you're allowed to torture me 
wait a moment until i'm gone 
i know you're the ticket, you gotta be 
'cause i let you be alone for long 
got to be so completely 
got to be so i can't hang on 

i'll be down, i'll be around 
i'll be hanging where eventually you'll have to be 
i'll just stare and hope you'll care 
it's only everything standing in front of me 

i'll be down, i'll be around 
i'll be hanging where eventually you'll have to be 
they're not there, you're standing there 
now you'll have to decide the fate of my sanity
