i've been a bad, bad girl
i've been careless with a delicate man
and it's a sad, sad world
when a girl will break a boy just because she can

don't you tell me to deny it
i've done wrong and i want to suffer for my sins
i've come to you 'cause i need guidance to be true
and i just don't know where i can begin

what i need is a good defense
'cause i'm feeling like a criminal
and i need to be redeemed
to the one i've sinned against
because he's all i ever knew of love

heaven help me for the way i am
save me from these evil deeds before i get them done
i know tomorrow brings the consequence at hand
but i keep living this day like the next will never come

oh help me but don't tell me to deny it
i've got to cleanse myself of all these lies 'till i'm good enough for him
i've got a lot to lose and i'm bettin' high so i'm begging you
before it ends just tell me where to begin

what i need is a good defense
'cause i'm feeling like a criminal
and i need to be redeemed
to the one i've sinned against
because he's all i ever knew of love

let me know the way
before there's hell to pay
give me room to lay the law and let me go
i've got to make a play
to make my lover stay
so what would an angel say the devil wants to know 

what i need is a good defense
'cause i'm feeling like a criminal
and i need to be redeemed
to the one i've sinned against
because he's all i ever knew of looooooooooooooooooooooooooove
yeah yeah yeah uhh uhh uhhhhhh...

hey hey hey haaayyyyyyyyyyyyy yeahhhhhhh yeahhhhhhhhhh hiyee ehhh...
