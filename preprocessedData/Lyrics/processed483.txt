there's a destination a little up the road
from the habitations and the towns we know
a place we saw the lights turn low
jig-saw jazz and the get-fresh flow

pulling out jives and jamboree handouts
two turntables and a microphone
bottles and cans and just clap your hands and just clap your hands

where it's at
i got two turntables and a microphone

take me home in my elevator bones!
that was a good drum break

pick yourself up off the side of the road
with your elevator bones and your whip-flash tones
members only, hyponotizers
move through the room like ambulance drivers
shine your shoes with your microphone blues
hirsutes with your parachute flutes
passing the dutchie from coast to coast
let the man gary wilson rock the most

where it's at
i got two turntables and a microphone

what about those who swing both ways: ac-dc's
