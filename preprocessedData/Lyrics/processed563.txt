ahh ahhh, ahh ahhh
you better beware, you better take care
you better watch out if you've got long black hair
he'll come from behind, you'll go out of your mind
you better not go, you never know what you'll find
ahh ahh, ahh ahhh

don't look into his eyes, you'll be surprised
if don't know what going on behind his disguse
nobody knows where buster goes
he'll steal your woman out from under your nose

does anyone know the way, did we hear someone say
(we just haven't got a clue what to do)
does anyone know the way, there's got to be a way
to blockbuster

the cops are out, they're running about
don't know if they'll ever be able to blockbuster out
he's gotta be caught, he's gotta be taught
'cause he is more evil then anyone here ever thought

does anybody know the way, did we hear someone say
(we just haven't got a aho)
does anybody know the way, there's got to be a way
