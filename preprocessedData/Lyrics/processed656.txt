working the village shop
putting a poster up
dreaming of anything
dreaming of the time when you are free from all the trouble you're in 
in the mud, on your knees
trying hard not to please
anyone, all the time
being a rebel's fine
but you go all the way to being brutal

you will have a boy tonight
you will have a boy tonight
on the first bus out of town
on the first bus out of town

let's see your kit for games
all the girls look the same
you are challenging style for running miles
you're running miles in some boys jumper

boo to the business world!
you know a girl who's tax free on her back and making
plenty cash
while you are working for the joy of giving

you will have a boy tonight
you will have a boy tonight
and you hope that she will see
and you hope that she will see

you will have a boy tonight
or maybe you will have a girl tonight
and you hope that she will see
and you hope that she will see

you are in two minds
tossing a coin to decide whether you should tell your mum
about a dose of thrush you got while you were licking railings

but you read in a book
that you got free in boots
there are lotions, there are potions
you can take to hide your shame from all those prying eyes

lazy jane, all the time
painting lines
you are sleeping at bus stops
wondering how you got your name
and what you're going to do about it

you will have a boy tonight
you will have a boy tonight
and you hope that she will see
and you hope that she will see
