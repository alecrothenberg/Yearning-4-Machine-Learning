standing tough under stars and stripes
we can tell
this dream's in sight
you've got to admit it
at this point in time that it's clear
the future looks bright
on that train all graphite and glitter
undersea by rail
ninety minutes from new york to paris
well by seventy-six we'll be a.o.k.

what a beautiful world this will be
what a glorious time to be free

get your ticket to that wheel in space
while there's time
the fix is in
you'll be a witness to that game of chance in the sky
you know we've got to win
here at home we'll play in the city
powered by the sun
perfect weather for a streamlined world
there'll be spandex jackets one for everyone

what a beautiful world this will be
what a glorious time to be free

on that train all graphite and glitter
undersea by rail
ninety minutes from new york to paris
(more leisure time for artists everywhere)
a just machine to make big decisions
programmed by fellows with compassion and vision
we'll be clean when their work is done
we'll be eternally free yes and eternally young

what a beautiful world this will be
what a glorious time to be free
 standing tough under stars and stripes
we can tell
