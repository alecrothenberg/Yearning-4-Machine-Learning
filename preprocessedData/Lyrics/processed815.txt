i've called you so many times today 
and i guess it's all true what your girl-friends say 
that you don't ever want to see me again 
and your brother's gonna kill me and he's six feet ten 
i guess you'd call it cowardice 
but i'm not prepared to go on like this 

i can't, i can't, i can't stand losing 
i can't, i can't, i can't stand losing 
i can't, i can't, i can't, i can't stand losing you 
i can't stand losing you 
i can't stand losing you 
i can't stand losing you 

i see you sent my letters back 
and my l.p. records and they're all scratched 
i can't see the point in another day 
when nobody listens to a word i say 
you can call it lack of confidence 
but to carry on living doesn't make no sense 

i can't, i can't, i can't stand losing 
i can't, i can't, i can't stand losing 
i can't, i can't, i can't stand losing 
i can't, i can't, i can't stand losing you 
i can't, i can't, i can't stand losing 
i can't, i can't, i can't stand losing 

i guess this is our last goodbye 
and you don't care, so i won't cry 
but you'll be sorry when i'm dead 
and all this guilt will be on your head 
i guess you'd call it suicide 
but i'm too full to swallow my pride 
i can't, i can't, i can't stand losing 
i can't, i can't...
