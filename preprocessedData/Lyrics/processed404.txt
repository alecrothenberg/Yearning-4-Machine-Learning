as i walk along i wonder a-what went wrong
with our love, a love that was so strong
and as i still walk on, i think of the things we've done
together, a-while our hearts were young

i'm a-walkin' in the rain
tears are fallin' and i feel the pain
wishin' you were here by me
to end this misery
and i wonder
i wa-wa-wa-wa-wonder
why
ah-why-why-why-why-why she ran away
and i wonder where she will stay
my little runaway, run-run-run-run-runaway
