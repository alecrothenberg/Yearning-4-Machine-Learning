well, i'm a king bee
buzzin' around yo' hive
well, i'm a king bee
buzzin' around yo' hive
well, i can make honey, baby
let me come inside

i'm young and able
to buzz all night long
i'm young and able
to buzz all night long
well, when you hear me buzzin', baby
some stingin' is going on

well, buzz awhile

(instrumental)

'sting-a-been'

well, i'm a king bee
want you to be my queen
well, i'm a king bee
want you to be my queen
together we can make honey
the world ever, never, seen

(harmonica & instrumental)

well, i'm a king bee
can buzz all night long
well, i'm a king bee
can buzz all night long
well, i can buzz better, baby
when yo' man is gone.
 well, i'm a king bee
buzzin' around yo' hive

buzzin' around yo' hive
