i can't believe that it's real,
the way that you make me feel.
a burning deep down inside,
a love that i cannot hide.
our love is you and me baby,
that makes the world go round.
and if you've been doin' lovin' with me,
layin' all my troubles down,
here i am, baby,
come and take me.
here i am, baby,
come and take me,
take me by the hand.
show me,
here i am, baby.

me begging you every day.
a love that i cannot have,
you broke my heart into half.
our love is you and me baby,
that make's the world go round.

layin' all my troubles down,

just my cup of joe.

i believe there's one to be explodin',
it's tough for me, oh baby,
