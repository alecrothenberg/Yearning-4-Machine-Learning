have you seen her face
she's got a face that would stop a clock
and with that face i surely won't stop
to look her in the eyes
but her money's green
she's a tease like a social disease
but she's still so close to my reach
if i call, if i call at all
any time at all [repeat x 4]

so the story goes
i think i'll take her for a ride
with this moneybag by my side
a gigolo is the only way to go
and so i show my face
and i can even fake a smile
but i'm laughing inside all the while
this little girl
she's a joke [repeat x 3]
any time at all [repeat x 4]

he's a whore, (i'd do anything for money)
he's a whore, (look at the things that i write)
he's a whore, (ooo, the stories i can tell)
he's a whore (in the morning, in the night) 
i'm a whore (he'll do anything for money)
i'm a whore (look at the clothes that he wears)
i'm a whore (he'll do anything for money
i'm a whore
