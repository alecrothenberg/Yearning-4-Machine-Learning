lonely feeling deep inside
find a corner where i can hide
silent footsteps crowding me
sudden darkness but i can see

no sugar tonight in my coffee
no sugar tonight in my tea
no sugar to stand beside me
no sugar to run with me

(dat'n-doo-dow-dow-dat'n-doo-dow)

in the silence of her mind
quiet movements where i can find
grabbing for me with her eyes
now i'm falling from her skies

no sugar tonight in my coffee
no sugar tonight in my tea
no sugar to stand beside me
no sugar to run with me

(dat'n-doo-dow-dow-dat'n-doo-dow

jocko says "yes," and i believe him
when we talk about the things i say
she hasn't got the faith or the guts to leave him
when they're standing in each other's way
you're tripping back now to places you've been to
you wonder what you're gonna find
you know you've been wrong but it won't be long
before you leave 'em all far behind

'cause it's the new mother nature taking over
it's the new splendid lady come to call
it's the new mother nature taking over
she's gettin' us all
she's gettin' us all.

jocko said "no," when i came back last time
it's looking like i lost a friend
no use callin' 'cause the sky is fallin'
and i'm getting pretty near the end
a smoke-filled room in a corner basement
the situation must be right
a bag of goodies and a bottle of wine
we're gonna get it on right tonight

'cause it's the new mother nature taking over
it's the new splendid lady come to call
it's the new mother nature taking over
she's gettin' us all
she's getting' us all
 lonely feeling deep inside
find a corner where i can hide
silent footsteps crowding me
sudden darkness but i can see

no sugar tonight in my coffee
no sugar tonight in my tea
no sugar to stand beside me
no sugar to run with me
