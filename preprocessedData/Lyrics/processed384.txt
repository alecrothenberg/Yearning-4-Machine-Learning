i'm 500 miles away from home
teardrops fell on momma's note
when i read the things she wrote
she said we miss you son we love you come on home
well i didn't have to pack
i had it all right on my back
now i'm 500 miles away from home
away from home away from home
cold and tired and all alone
yes, i'm 500 miles away from home

i know this is the same road i took the day i left home,
but it sure looks different now. and i guess i look 
different too, cause time changes everything. i wonder what
they'll say, when they see their boy looking this bad.

oh i wonder what they'll say when i get home
can't remember when i ate
it's just thumb and walk and wait
and i'm still 500 miles away from home
if my luck had been just right
i'd be with them all tonight
but i'm 500 miles away from home
away from home away from home
oh i'm still 500 miles away from home
 i'm 500 miles away from home
