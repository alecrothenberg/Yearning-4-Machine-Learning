oh, i could hide 'neath the wings
of the bluebird as she sings.
the six o'clock alarm would never ring.
but it rings and i rise,
wipe the sleep out of my eyes.
my shavin' razor's cold and it stings.

cheer up, sleepy jean.
oh, what can it mean.
to a daydream believer
and a homecoming queen.

you once thought of me
as a white knight on a steed.
now you know how happy i can be.
oh, and our good times start and end
without dollar one to spend.
but how much, baby, do we really need.

cheer up, sleepy jean.
oh, what can it mean.
to a daydream believer
and a homecoming queen.
cheer up, sleepy jean.
oh, what can it mean.
to a daydream believer
and a homecoming queen.

[instrumental interlude]

cheer up, sleepy jean.
oh, what can it mean.
to a daydream believer
and a homecoming queen.
