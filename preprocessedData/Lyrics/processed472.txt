he was sitting in the lounge of the empire hotel
he was drinking for diversion 
he was thinking for himself 
a little money riding on the maple leafs 
along comes a lady in lacy sleeves
she says let me sit down
you know, drinkin' alone's a shame
it's a shame it's a crying shame
look at those jokers 
glued to that damn hockey game 
hey honey-you've got lots of cash 
bring us round a bottle 
and we'll have some laughs 
gin's what i'm drinking 
i was raised on robbery

i'm a pretty good cook 
i'm sitting on my groceries 
come up to my kitchen
i'll show you my best recipe 
i try and i try but i can't save a cent
i'm up after midnight cooking
trying to make my rent
i'm rough but i'm pleasin' 
i was raised on robbery

we had a little money once
they were pushing through a four lane highway
government gave us three thousand dollars
you should have seen it fly away 
first he bought a '57 biscayne 
he put it in the ditch
he drunk up all the rest
that son of a bitch 
his blood's bad whiskey 
i was raised on robbery 

you know you ain't bad looking
i like the way you hold your drinks
come home with me honey
i ain't asking for no full length mink
hey, where you going
don't go yet
your glass ain't empty and we just met
you're mean when your loaded
i was raised on robbery
