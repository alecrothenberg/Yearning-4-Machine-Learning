ahhhhhh oooooo

this is the way
i always dreamed it would be
the way that it is, oh oh
when you are holding me
i never had a love of my own
maybe that's why when we're all alone

i can hear music
i can hear music
the sound of the city baby seems to disappear
i can hear music
sweet sweet music
whenever you touch me baby
whenever you're near

lovin' you
it keeps me satisfied
and i can't explain, oh no
the way i'm feeling inside
you look at me we kiss and then
i close my eyes and here it comes again

i can hear music

the sound of the city baby seems to disappear
i can hear music
sweet sweet music
whenever you touch me baby
whenever you're near
