i'm feelin' mighty lonesome
haven't slept a wink
i walk the floor from nine to four
in between i drink
black coffee
love's a hand-me-down brew
i'll never know a sunday
in this weekday room

i'm talkin to the shadow
one o'clock till four
and lord, how slow the moments go
and all i do is pour
black coffee
since the blues caught my eye
i'm hangin' out on monday
my sunday dreams to dry

now man was born to go a lovin'
but was a woman born to weep and fret
and stay at home and tend her oven
and down her past regrets
in coffee and cigarettes

i'm moonin' all the mornin'
moanin' all the night
and in between it's nicotine
and not much heart to fight
black coffee
feelin' low as the ground
it's drivin' me crazy
this thinkin' 'bout my baby
might maybe come around
come aroundi'm feelin' mighty lonesome
haven't slept a wink
i walk the floor from nine to four
in between i drink
black coffee
love's a hand-me-down brew
i'll never know a sunday
in this weekday room

i'm talkin to the shadow
one o'clock till four
and lord, how slow the moments go
and all i do is pour
