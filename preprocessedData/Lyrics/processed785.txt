temperature's rising
fever is high
can't see no future
can't see no sky

my feet are so heavy
so is my head
i wish i was a baby
i wish i was dead

cold turkey has got me on the run
body is aching
goose-pimple bone
can't see no body
leave me alone

my eyes are wide open
can't get to sleep
one thing i'm sure of
i'm at the deep freeze

cold turkey has got me on the run
cold turkey has got me on the run

thirty-six hours
rolling in pain
praying to someone
free me again

oh i'll be a good boy
please make me well 
i promise you anything
get me out of this hell

cold turkey has got me on the run
