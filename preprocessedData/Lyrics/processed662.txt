every day she takes a morning bath she wets her hair
wraps a towel around her as she's heading for the bedroom chair
it's just another day
slipping into stockings, stepping into shoes
dipping in the pocket of her raincoat
it's just another day
at the office where the papers grow she takes a break
drinks another coffe and she finds it hard to stay awake
it's just another day

do do do do do do, it's just another day
do do do do do do, it's just another day

[chorus]
so sad, do sad
sometimes she feels so sad
alone in her apartment she'd dwell
till the man of her dreams come to break the spell
ah, stay, don't stand her up
and he comes and he stays but he leaves the next day
so sad
sometimes she feels so sad

as she posts another letter to the sound of five
people gather 'round her and she finds it hard to stay alive

do do do do do do, it's just another day
do do do do do do, it's just another day

[chorus]

every day she takes a morning bath she wets her hair
wraps a towel around her as she's heading for the bedroom chair
it's just another day
slipping into stockings, stepping into shoes
dipping in the pocket of her raincoat
it's just another day

do do do do do do, it's just another day
do do do do do do, it's just another day
 every day she takes a morning bath she wets her hair
wraps a towel around her as she's heading for the bedroom chair
it's just another day
slipping into stockings, stepping into shoes
