years ago, my heart was set to live, oh
but i've been trying hard against unbelievable odds
it gets so hard at times like now to hold on
my guns they're waiting to be stuck by
at my side is god

and there ain't no one gonna turn me 'round
ain't no one gonna turn me 'round

there's people around who tell you that they know
the places where they send you, and it's easy to go
they'll zip you up and dress you down
stand you in a row
but you know you don't have to
you can just say no

and there ain't no one gonna turn me 'round
ain't no one gonna turn me 'round
ain't no one gonna turn me 'round
ain't no one gonna turn me 'round

i've been built up and trusted
broke down and busted
but they'll get theirs and we'll get ours
just if we can
just, ah, hold on
hold on
hold on
hold on

years ago my heart was set to live, oh
but i've been trying hard against strong odds
it gets so hard at times like now to hold on
well, i'll fall if i don't fight
and at my side is god

ain't no one gonna turn me 'round
ain't no one gonna turn me 'round
ain't no one gonna turn me 'round
ain't no one gonna turn me 'round
hold on
hold on
hold on
hold on

[alternate lines of last verse:]
years ago i was all set to go
and i've been trying hard against long odds
it gets so hard at times like this to even hang around
i can either stand or fall
and i believe i'm gonna stand tall
