this is our last goodbye
i hate to feel the love between us die
but it's over
just hear this before i go
you gave me more to live for
more than you'll ever know
this is our last embrace
must i dream and always see your face?
why can't we overcome this and more?
baby, maybe its 'cause you didn't know me at all
kiss me, please kiss me
but kiss me out of desire, babe, not consolation
oh, you know it makes me so angry
cause i know that in time, i'll only make you cry
this is our last goodbye
did you say, "no, this can't happen to me"
did you rush to the phone to call
was there a voice unkind in the back of your mind
saying maybe you didn't know him at all
well, the bells out in the church tower chime
burning clues into this heart of mine
thinking so hard on her soft eyes
and the memories offer signs that it's over
over...
