i was a stranger
when i came to town
just yesterday 
i was a stranger
they dont come much stranger

so why
why did you believe
all every word i said
why did you believe
believe a stranger
a stranger

and why do you women in this town
let me look at you so bold
when you have seen what i was
in the last town
in the last town
you should have seen what i was
if i was a stranger
i was worse than a stranger
i was well-known
 i was a stranger
when i came to town
just yesterday 
i was a stranger
they dont come much stranger

so why
why did you believe
all every word i said
why did you believe
believe a stranger
a stranger

and why do you women in this town
let me look at you so bold
when you have seen what i was
in the last town
in the last town
you should have seen what i was
if i was a stranger
i was worse than a stranger
i was well-known
 i was a stranger
when i came to town
just yesterday 
i was a stranger
they dont come much stranger

so why
why did you believe
all every word i said
why did you believe
believe a stranger
