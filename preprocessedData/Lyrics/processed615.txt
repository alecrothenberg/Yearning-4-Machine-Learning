tooling down the hightway doing 79
i'm a twin pipe papa and i'm feelin fine
hey man dig that was that a red stop sign
[scrreeech-bang, tinkle]
transfusion, transfusion
i'm just a solid mess of contusions
never, never, never gonna speed again
slip the blood to me, bud

i jump in my rod about a quarter to nine
i gotta make a date with that chick of mine
i cross the center line man you gotta make time-
[scrreeech-bang, tinkle]
transfusion, transfusion
oh, man, i got the cotton pickin convolutions
never, never, never gonna speed again
shoot the juice to me, bruce

my foot's on the throttle and it's made of lead
but i'm a fast ridding daddy with a real cool head
i'ma gonna pass a truck on the hill ahead-
[scrreeech-bang, tinkle]
transfusion, transfusion
my red corpsuckles (sic) are in mass confusion
never, never, never gonna speed again
pass the crimson to me, jimson

i took a little drink and i'm feelin right
i can fly right over everything everything in sight
there's a slow poking cat i'm gonna pass him on the right
[scrreeech-bang, tinkle]
transfusion, transfusion
i'm a real gone paleface and that's no illusion
i'ma never never never gonna speed again
pass the claret to me, barrett

a rollin down the mountain on a rainy day
oh, when you see me coming better start to pray
i'm a cuttin' up the road and i'm the boss all the way
[scrreeech-bang, tinkle]
transfusion, transfusion
oh, doc, pardon me for this crazy intrusion
i'm never, never, never gonna speed again
pump the fluid in me, louie

i'm burning up the highway early this morn
i'm passing everybody oh nothing but corn
man outa my way i don't drive with my horn
[scrreeech-bang, tinkle]
transfusion, transfusion
oh, nurse i'm gonna make a new resolution
i'm never, never, never gonna speed again
