i'm going up the country, babe don't you wanna go
i'm going up the country, babe don't you wanna go
i'm going to some place where i've never been before
i'm going, i'm going where the water tastes like wine
well i'm going where the water tastes like wine
we can jump in the water, stay drunk all the time
i'm gonna leave this city, got to get away
i'm gonna leave this city, got to get away
all this fussing and fighting, man, you know i sure can't stay
now baby, pack your leaving trunk, you know we've got to leave today
just exactly where we're going i cannot say, 
but we might even leave the usa 
'cause there's a brand new game that i want to play
no use of you running, or screaming and crying
'cause you've got a home as long as i've got mine
