woke up one morning half asleep
with all my blankets in a heap
and yellow roses scattered all around
the time was still approaching
for i couldn't stand it anymore
some marigolds upon my eiderdown

i'm just sitting watching flowers in the rain
feel the power of the rain making the garden grow
i'm just sitting watching flowers in the rain
feel the power of the rain keeping me good

so i lay upon my side
with all the windows open wide
couldn't pressurize my head from speaking
hoping not to make a sound
i pushed my bed into the grounds
in time to catch the sight that i was seeking

[repeat]

if this perfect pleasure has to be
then this is paradise to me
if my pillow's getting wet
i can't see that it matters much to me

i heard the flowers in the breeze
make conversation with the trees
relieved to leave reality behind me
with my commitments in a mess
my sleep is not a way of rest
in a world of fantasy you'll find me

[repeat]

watching flowers in the rain
flowers in the rain
power flowers in the rain
flower power in the rain

[fade out]woke up one morning half asleep
