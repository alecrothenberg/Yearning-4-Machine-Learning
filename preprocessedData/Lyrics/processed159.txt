i don't want you to be no slave
i don't want you to work all day
i don't want you to be true
i just want to make love to you

i don't want you to wash my clothes
i don't want you to keep my home
i don't want your money too
i just want to make love to you

well i can see by the way that you switch and walk
and i can tell by the way that you baby talk
and i know by the way that you treat your man
i wanna love you baby, it's a cryin' shame

i don't want you to bake my bread
i don't want you to make my bed
i don't want you cause i'm sad and blue
i just want to make love to you
 
i don't want you to be no slave
i don't want you to work all day
i don't want you to be true
i just want to make love to you

i don't want you to wash my clothes
i don't want you to keep my home
i don't want your money too
i just want to make love to you

well i can see by the way that you switch and walk
and i can tell by the way that you baby talk
and i know by the way that you treat your man
i wanna love you baby, it's a cryin' shame

i don't want you to bake my bread
i don't want you to make my bed
i don't want you cause i'm sad and blue
i just want to make love to you
