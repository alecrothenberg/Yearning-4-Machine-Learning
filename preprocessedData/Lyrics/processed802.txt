ah, the woman i love, took from my best friend, some joker got lucky, stole her back again
you better come on in my kitchen, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors
 

ohah, she's gone, i know she won't come back
i've taken the last nickel out of her nation sack
you better come on in my kitchen, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors
(spoken: oh, can't you hear that wind howl?)
oh y', can't you hear that wind would howl?
you better come on in my kitchen, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors

when a woman gets in trouble, everybody throws her down
  
lookin' for her good friend, none can be found
you better come on in my kitchen, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors
