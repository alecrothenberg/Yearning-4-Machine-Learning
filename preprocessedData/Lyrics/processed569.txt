ride it on out like a bird in the sky ways
ride it on out like you were a bird
fly it all out like an eagle in a sunbeam
ride it on out like you were a bird

wear a tall hat like a druid in the old days
wear a tall hat and a tatooed gown
ride a white swan like the people of the beltane
wear your hair long, babe you can't go wrong

catch a bright star and a place it on your fore-head
say a few spells and baby, there you go
take a black cat and sit it on your shoulder
and in the morning you'll know all you know, oh

wear a tall hat like a druid in the old days
wear a tall hat and a tatooed gown
ride a white swan like the people of the beltane
wear your hair long, babe you can't go wrong
