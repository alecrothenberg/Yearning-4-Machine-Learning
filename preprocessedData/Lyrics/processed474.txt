there you stood on the edge of your feather, 
     expecting to fly. 
     while i laughed, i wondered whether 
     i could wave goodbye, 
     knowin' that you'd gone. 
     by the summer it was healing, 
     we had said goodbye. 
     all the years we'd spent with feeling 
     ended with a cry, 
     babe, ended with a cry, 
     babe, ended with a cry. 
      
     i tried so hard to stand 
     as i stumbled and fell to the ground. 
     so hard to laugh as i fumbled 
     and reached for the love i found, 
     knowin' it was gone. 
     if i never lived without you, 
     now you know i'd die. 
     if i never said i loved you, 
     now you know i'd try, 
     babe, now you know i'd try. 
     babe, now you know i'd try, 
     babe.
