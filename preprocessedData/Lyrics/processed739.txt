i've never known a girl like you before
now just like in a song from days of yore
here you come a knockin' knockin' on my door
and i've never met a girl like you before

you gave me just a taste so i want more
now my hands are bleeding and my knees are raw
'cause now you've got me crawlin' crawlin' on the floor
and i've never known a girl like you before

you've made me acknowledge the devil in me
i hope to god i'm talkin' metaphorically
hope that i'm talkin' allegorically
know that i'm talkin' about the way i feel

and i've never known a girl like you before
never, never, never, never
never known a girl like you before

this old town's changed so much
don't feel like i belong
too many protest singers
not enough protest songs

and now you've come along
yes you've come along
and i've never met a girl like you before
 i've never known a girl like you before
now just like in a song from days of yore
here you come a knockin' knockin' on my door
and i've never met a girl like you before

you gave me just a taste so i want more
now my hands are bleeding and my knees are raw
'cause now you've got me crawlin' crawlin' on the floor
and i've never known a girl like you before

you've made me acknowledge the devil in me
i hope to god i'm talkin' metaphorically
hope that i'm talkin' allegorically
know that i'm talkin' about the way i feel

and i've never known a girl like you before
never, never, never, never
never known a girl like you before

this old town's changed so much
