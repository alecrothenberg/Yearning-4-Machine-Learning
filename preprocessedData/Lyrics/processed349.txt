in my hour of darkness
in my time of need
oh, lord grant me vision
oh, lord grant me speed

once i knew a young man
went driving through the night
miles and miles without a word
with just his high-beam lights
who'd have ever though they'd build such
a deadly denver bend
to be so strong, to take as long as
it would till the end

in my hour of darkness
in my time of need
oh, lord grant me vision
oh, lord grant me speed

another young man safely strummed his
silver string guitar
and he played to people everywhere
some say he was a star
but he was just a country boy,
his simple songs confess
and the music he had in him,
so very few possess

in my hour of darkness
in my time of need
oh, lord grant me vision
oh, lord grant me speed

then there was an old man
kind and wise with age
and he read me just like a book and he
never missed a page
and i loved him like my father
and i loved him like my friend
and i knew his time would shortly come
but i did not know just when

in my hour of darkness
in my time of need
oh, lord grant me vision
oh, lord grant me speed
oh, lord grant me vision
oh, lord grant me speed
