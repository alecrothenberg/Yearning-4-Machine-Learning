well i wish i had known your name 
is it possible that we might have felt the same 
'bout the senselessness within the air 
paints it's words almost everywhere 
now the sun will always shine on this palomine 

well i wish i had known you then 
well who knows i might have been a better friend 
but now the senselessness within the air 
paints it's words almost everywhere 
how come life sometimes makes you feel so scared 
i know the sun will always shine (2x) 
yes the sun will always shine on this palomine 

well even when i think out about 
the things you used to say out loud 
even then i can't say i was prepared 
to settle down to what you did 
you made your choice and that was it 
how come life sometimes makes you feel so scared 
i know the sun will always shine (2x) 
yes the sun will always shine on this palomine
