i should have known you'd bid me farewell
there's a lesson to be learned from this and i learned it very well
now i know you're not the only starfish in the sea
if i never hear your name again, it's all the same to me

and i think it's gonna be all right
yeah, the worst is over now
the mornin' sun is shinin' like a red rubber ball

you never care for secrets i confide
for you i'm just an ornament, somethin' for your pride
always runnin', never carin', that's the life you live
stolen minutes of your time were all ya had to give

and i think it's gonna be all right
yeah, the worst is over now
the mornin' sun is shinin' like a red rubber ball

the story's in the past with nothin' to recall
i've got my life to live and i don't need you at all
the roller-coaster ride we took is nearly at an end
i bought my ticket with my tears, that's all i'm gonna spend

and i think it's gonna be all right
yeah, the worst is over now
the mornin' sun is shinin' like a red rubber ball

oh, oh, oh
i think it's gonna be all right
yeah, the worst is over now
the mornin' sun is shinin' like a red rubber ball
