i'm a full grown man
that's plain to see
but nowhere near as full grown
as i'd like to be
but i'll find a bar
and i'll have a few
until i'm ten feet tall and bulletproof
now, i'd hit the dance floor
each time i'd have the chance
that is if these two left feet
knew how to dance
'bout the only time
i'm kicking up my shoes
is when i'm ten feet tall and bulletproof

well, i start to feel like superman
then i pick a fight
only to find that my opponent's
holding kryptonite
you'd think i'd learn my lesson
but, i'm still paying dues
each time i drink and start to think
i'm ten feet tall and bulletproof

my woman left me
she called me a clown
well that's the general consensus
in this town
but i had it coming
lord to tell the truth
for acting ten feet tall and bulletproof 

repeat chorus
