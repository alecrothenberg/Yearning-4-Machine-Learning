you can dance
you can jive
having the time of your life
see that girl
watch that scene
dig in the dancing queen

friday night and the lights are low
looking out for a place to go
where they play the right music
getting in the swing
you come to look for a king
anybody could be that guy
night is young and the music's high
with a bit of rock music
everything is fine
you're in the mood for a dance
and when you get the chance

you are the dancing queen
young and sweet
only seventeen
dancing queen
feel the beat from the tambourine
you can dance
you can jive
having the time of your life
see that girl
watch that scene
dig in the dancing queen

you're a teaser, you turn 'em on
leave 'em burning and then you're gone
looking out for another
anyone will do
you're in the mood for a dance
and when you get the chance

you are the dancing queen
young and sweet
only seventeen
dancing queen
feel the beat from the tambourine
you can dance
you can jive
having the time of your life
see that girl
