willy picks a tune out and he blows it on the harp.

down on the corner, out in the street,
willy and the poorboys are playin';

blinky, thumps the gut bass and solos for a while.
poorboy twangs the rhythm out on his kalamazoo.
willy goes into a dance and doubles on kazoo.

but if you've got a nickel, won't you lay your money down?
