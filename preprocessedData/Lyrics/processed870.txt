crack of dawn
cindy's movin' on
talking cindy to everyone
until she's had her fun

she has me
we twist the sun and sea
still she's talking to everyone
cindy's had her fun

though i've heard it before
still i need you more and more
but i just can't get away
cindy kills me every day

and i tried and i tried
but you looked right through me
knife to my head when she talks so sweetly
knife in my head when i think of cindy
knife in my head is the taste of cindy
 crack of dawn
cindy's movin' on
talking cindy to everyone
until she's had her fun

she has me
we twist the sun and sea
still she's talking to everyone
cindy's had her fun

though i've heard it before
still i need you more and more
but i just can't get away
cindy kills me every day

and i tried and i tried
but you looked right through me
knife to my head when she talks so sweetly
knife in my head when i think of cindy
knife in my head is the taste of cindy
