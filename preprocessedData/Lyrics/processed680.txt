that's great, it starts with an earthquake
birds and snakes, and aeroplanes, 
and lenny bruce is not afraid

eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn
world serves its own needs, don't mis-serve your own needs
speed it up a notch, speed, grunt, no, strength,
the ladder starts to clatter with a fear of height, down, height
wire in a fire, represent the seven games
and a government for hire and a combat site
left her, wasn't coming in a hurry with the furies breathing down your neck

team by team, reporters baffled, trumped, tethered, cropped
look at that low plane, fine, then
uh oh, overflow, population, common group
but it'll do, save yourself, serve yourself
world serves its own needs, listen to your heart bleed
tell me with the rapture and the reverent in the right, right
you vitriolic, patriotic, slam fight, bright light
feeling pretty psyched

it's the end of the world as we know it
it's the end of the world as we know it
it's the end of the world as we know it and i feel fine

six o'clock, t.v. hour, don't get caught in foreign tower
slash and burn, return, listen to yourself churn
lock him in uniform, book burning, bloodletting
every motive escalate, automotive incinerate
light a candle, light a motive, step down, step down
watch your heel crush, crush, uh oh
this means no fear, cavalier, renegade and steering clear
a tournament, a tournament, a tournament of lies
offer me solutions, offer me alternatives and i decline

it's the end of the world as we know it (i had some time alone)

the other night i dreamt a nice continental drift divide
mountains sit in a line, leonard bernstein
leonid brezhnev, lenny bruce and lester bangs
birthday party, cheesecake, jellybean, boom
you symbiotic, patriotic, slam but neck, right? right!
