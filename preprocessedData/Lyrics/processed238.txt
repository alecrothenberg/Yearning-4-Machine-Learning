folks, now here's the story 'bout minnie the moocher, 
she was a red-hot hootchie-cootcher, 
she was the roughest, toughest frail, 
but minnie had a heart as big as a whale. 

[call and response scat chorus differs every time. the following is simplified:] 
hi-de-hi-de-hi-di-hi! 
ho-de-ho-de-ho-de-ho! 
he-de-he-de-he-de-he! 
ho-de-ho-de-ho! 

now, she messed around with a bloke named smoky, 
she loved him though he was cokie, 
he took her down to chinatown, 
he showed her how to kick the gong around. 

now, she had a dream about the king of sweden, 
he gave her things that she was needin', 
he gave her a home built of gold and steel, 
a diamond car with a platinum wheel. 

now, he gave her his townhouse and his racing horses, 
each meal she ate was a dozen courses; 
she had a million dollars worth of nickels and dimes, 
and she sat around and counted them all a billion times. 

poor min, poor min, poor min.
