nothin' for us in belfast
the pound's so old it's a pity
ok, there's the trident in bangor
then walk back to the city
we ain't got nothin' but they don't really care
they don't even know you know
just want our money
and we can take it or leave it
what we need

[chorus] an alternative ulster
grab it and change it it's yours
get an alternative ulster
ignore the bores and their laws
get an alternative ulster
be an anti-security force
alter your native ulster
alter you native land

take a look where you're livin'
you got the army on your street
and the ruc dog of repression
is barking at your feet
is this the kind of place you want to live?
is this where you want to be?
is this the only life we're gonna have?
what we need is

[chorus]

they say they've got control of you
but that's not true you know
they say they're a part of you
and that's a lie you know
they say you will never be
free free free
