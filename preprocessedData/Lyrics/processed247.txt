dearly beloved
we are gathered here today to get through this thing called life
electric word life, it means 4ever and that's a mighty long time
but i'm here 2 tell u there's somethin' else, the afterworld

a world of never ending happiness
u can always see the sun, day or night
so when u call up that shrink in beverly hills
u know the one - dr. everything'll be alright

instead of asking him how much of your time is left
ask him how much of your mind, baby
cuz in this life things are much harder than in the afterworld
in this life u're on your own

and if de-elevator tries 2 bring u down, go crazy
punch a higher floor!
if u don't like the world u're living in
take a look around u, at least u got friends
u see, i called my old lady 4 a friendly word
she just picked up the phone, dropped it on the floor
ahh! ahh! was all i heard

chorus:

are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
oh no, let's go! let's go crazy, let's get nuts
let's look 4 the purple banana till they put us in the truck
let's go!

we're all excited, but we don't know why
maybe it's cuz we're all gonna die
and when we do, what's it all 4?
u better live now before the grim reaper
come knockin' on your door
tell me...

chorus

come on, baby let's get nuts!
yeah (crazy) let's go crazy
are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
oh no, let's go crazy! (go crazy!)
i said let's go crazy! (go crazy!)
let's go! (let's go!) go! (let's go!)

dr. everything'll be alright will make everything go wrong
pills and thrills and daffodils will kill
hang tough children, he's coming!
he's coming! coming! take me away!
