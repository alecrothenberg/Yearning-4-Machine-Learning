bring me home to this house of many days
just lay me on the floor hard and cool as slate
you know i love it more and more than before i ran away
it triggers off so many hurts hurtful words and broken plates

i lied to
now i'm fuzzy
i've been lied to

all and all the world is small enough for both of us
to meet upon the interstate waiting on a train
and just when those big arms lift up fall in love with no time to say it

i liked to
now i'm fuzzy
i've lied to
now i'm fuzzy
fuzzy now

oh oh oh

here we are in our car driving down the street
we're looking for a place to stop have a bite to eat
we hunger for a bit of faith to replace the fear
we water like a dead bouquet does no good does it dear

i lied to
now i'm fuzzy
we've been lied to
now i'm fuzzy
fuzzy now
lied to

oh oh oh
