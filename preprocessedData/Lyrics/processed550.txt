with every wind
i hear you sing
"you will be fine"
with every note
stuck in your throat
"this is your time", but
everyone is just walking away from me
am i really that nasty
all the dust and dirt affects my skin
everyone is just turning away from me
am i really that filthy
it's cold and dark, let me in

i'm in love with this land of plenty
full of folks that still are friendly
i've lost my will, still i see some hope
give me a rope, i'll take it gladly
find me a tree, make it sturdy
bye ma! it's my time to go
yes this one's for the deadwith every wind
i hear you sing
"you will be fine"
with every note
stuck in your throat
"this is your time", but
everyone is just walking away from me
am i really that nasty
all the dust and dirt affects my skin
everyone is just turning away from me
am i really that filthy
it's cold and dark, let me in

i'm in love with this land of plenty
