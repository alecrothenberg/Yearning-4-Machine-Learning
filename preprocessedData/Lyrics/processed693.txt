suburbia, where the suburbs met utopia
(where the suburbs met utopia)

lost in the high street, where the dogs run
roaming suburban boys
mother's got a hairdo to be done
she says they're too old for toys
stood by the bus stop with a felt pen
in this suburban hell
and in the distance a police car
to break the suburban spell

let's take a ride, and run with the dogs tonight
in suburbia
you can't hide, run with the dogs tonight
in suburbia

break a window by the town hall
listen, the siren screams
there in the distance, like a roll call
of all the suburban dreams

let's take a ride, and run with the dogs tonight
in suburbia
you can't hide, run with the dogs tonight
in suburbia

i only wanted something else to do but hang around
i only wanted something else to do but hang around
(hang around, hang around)

it's on the front page of the papers
this is their hour of need
where's a policeman when you need one
to blame the colour tv?

let's take a ride, and run with the dogs tonight
in suburbia
you can't hide, run with the dogs tonight
in suburbia

run with the dogs tonight
you can't hide
run with the dogs tonight
you can't hide
(you can't hide, you can't hide)
in suburbia

(suburbia, where the suburbs met utopia)
(what kind of dream was this, so easy to destroy?)
(a world together, the cities of the past)
