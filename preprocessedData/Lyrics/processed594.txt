gather 'round, cats, and i'll tell you a story 
about how to become an all american boy
buy you a guitar and put it in tune
you'll be rockin' and rollin' soon.
impressin' the girls, pickin' hot licks, and all that jazz

i-i bought me a guitar a year ago 
learned how to play in a day or so
and all around town it was well understood
that i was knockin' 'em out like johnny b. goode
hot licks, showin' off, ah number one.

well , i 'd practice all day and up into the night
my papa's hair was turnin' white
cause he didn't like rock'n'roll
he said "you can stay, boy, but that's gotta go."
he's a square, he just didn't dig me at all

so i took my guitar, picks and all
and bid farewell to my poor ole pa
and i split for memphis where they say all
them swingin' cats are havin' a ball
sessions, hot licks and all, they dig me

i was rockin' and boppin' and i's a gettin' the breaks
the girls all said that i had what it takes
when up stepped a man with a big cigar 
he said "come here, cat--i'm gonnna make you a star."
"i'll put you on bandstand, buy ya a cadillac, sign here, kid."

i signed my name and became a star 
havin' a ball with my guitar
driving a big long cadillac and fightin' the girls off ma back
they just kept a'comin', screamin', yeah-they like it

so i'd pick my guitar with a great big grin
and the money just kept on pourin' in
but then one day my uncle sam
he said (sound of 3 footsteps) "here i am"
"uncle sam needs you, boy 
i'm-a gonna cut your hair
ah-take this rifle, kid
gimme that guitar" yeah.
