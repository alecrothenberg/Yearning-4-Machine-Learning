movin' to the country,

movin' to the country,

movin' to the country,
gonna eat a lot of peaches

peaches come from a can,
they were put there by a man
in a factory downtown
if i had my little way,
i'd eat peaches every day
sun-soakin' bulges in the shade

take a little naps where the roots all twist
squished a rotten peach in my fist
and dreamed about you, woman,
i poked my finger down inside
make a little room for it to hide
nature's candy in my hand or can or a pie

millions of peaches, peaches for me
millions of peaches, peaches for free

look out!
