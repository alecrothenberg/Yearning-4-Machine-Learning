baby gave us away today.
she broke my heart. i can't beg her to stay this time.
i wanna go right out and find a girl.
it's been a long time and i'm seeing the world
through different eyes, through different eyes.
oh baby, i ain't begging but i feel like dancing
and would you let a city boy
hold hands with you? i wanna get to know you.
i never thought of myself as tied down,
but i was so much in love.
it was good that she put me down,
i need someone new, someone who's
gonna make my heart jump the way she usta do.

all kindsa girls, all kindsa girls.

i think i'm falling in love again.

all kindsa girls, all kindsa girls.

they make me glad i'm a man, i said.

all kindsa girls, all kindsa girls.

i feel so good, that's right!

i take a green eyed girl, she's going to the square,
i'll take a chance, although i ain't going nowhere.
but i wanna go, i wanna go too.
i'll take a northern girl when her parents ain't home
we watching tv and we're all alone
and i wanna know all kindsa girls.
i never thought i'd see the day she'd turn her back on me.
but my baby get's her way today.

gonna make my heart jump the way she usta do.
