mmh mmh
well what's up with this guy, do you really like him that much?
yes, honey, i love him, he is fine, he does alot of nice things for me
i know he use to do nice stuff for you, but what has he done for you
lately?

used to be a time when you would pamper me
usta brag about it all the time
your friends seem to think that you're so peachy keen
but my friends say neglect is on your mind - who's right?

what have you done for me lately?
ooh ooh ooh yeah
what have you done for me lately?
ooh ooh ooh yeah

used to go to dinner almost every night
dancin' 'til i thought i'd lose my breath
now it seems your dancing feet are always on my couch
good thing i cook or else we'd starve to death - ain't that a shame?

what have you done for me lately
ooh ooh ooh yeah
what have you done for me lately
ooh ooh ooh yeah

i never ask for more than i deserve
you know it's the truth
you seem to think you're god's gift to this earth
i'm tellin' you no way

you 'ought to be thankful for the little things
but little things are all you seem to give
you're always putting off what we could do today
soap opera says
you've got one life to live
who's right, who's wrong?

what have you done for me lately
ooh ooh ooh yeah...

ooh ooh ooh yeah...

get wit it...uh
what have you done for me lately ooh ooh ooh yeah
