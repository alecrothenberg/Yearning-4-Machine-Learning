last night i took a walk after dark
a swinging place called palisades park
to have some fun and see what i could see
that's where the girls are

i took a ride on a shoot the chute
that girl i sat beside was awful cute
and when we stopped
she was holding hands with me

my heart was flying up like a rocket ship
down like a roller coaster
fast like a loop the loop
and around like a merry-go-round

we ate and ate at a hot dog stand
we danced around to a rocking band
and when i could, i gave that girl a hug
in the tunnel of love

you'll never know how great a kiss can feel
when you stop at the top of a ferris wheel
when i fell in love down at palisades park

we ate and ate at a hot dog stand
we danced around to a rocking band
and when i could, i gave that girl a hug
in the tunnel of love

you'll never know how great a kiss can feel
when you stop at the top of a ferris wheel
when i fell in love down at palisades park

down at palisades park
you know it's palisades park
down at palisades park
