counting backwards i count you in
i don't remember him
i don't remember
in time i rope you in again
i try and turn you back through him
i built a tower in my bones
i spill the mortar through my home
don't let your heartbeat beat keep you safe
no telling what keeps me awake
one hundred fingerprints i hear
a hundred linger in my ear
measure fortune killing time
 counting backwards i count you in
i don't remember him
i don't remember
in time i rope you in again
i try and turn you back through him
i built a tower in my bones
i spill the mortar through my home
don't let your heartbeat beat keep you safe
no telling what keeps me awake
one hundred fingerprints i hear
a hundred linger in my ear
measure fortune killing time
 counting backwards i count you in
i don't remember him
i don't remember
in time i rope you in again
i try and turn you back through him
i built a tower in my bones
i spill the mortar through my home
don't let your heartbeat beat keep you safe
no telling what keeps me awake
one hundred fingerprints i hear
a hundred linger in my ear
measure fortune killing time
 counting backwards i count you in
i don't remember him
i don't remember
in time i rope you in again
i try and turn you back through him
i built a tower in my bones
i spill the mortar through my home
don't let your heartbeat beat keep you safe
no telling what keeps me awake
one hundred fingerprints i hear
a hundred linger in my ear
measure fortune killing time
