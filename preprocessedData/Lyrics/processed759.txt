just...like... uniblab, robotic kickin' flab
my flavor be the badder
chitter-chatter
madder than the mad hatter (1)
i bet you my shit come out fatter
got the data

you'll fit inside my stomach 
with the eggs and grits between  {...take 'em down, mack...}
the king is what i mean
i mean
my man get a cup 
and put some change inside your hand {...take 'em down, mack...}
now hold up, 
let's make this official  {...make it official}
everybody let's agree that m.c.'s need a tissue {..wake 'em up}
the funk's my only issue,
i bet your mama miss you
and i bet the mack take off like an m.x. missile
no more of your whining
on the charts climbing
as i make the funk 
kickin' out more harder than a diamond  {...harder than a diamond}
and if you didn't know who's rhyming
i guess i'm gonna say craig mack
with perfect timing

..you won't be around next year
my rap's too severe, kickin' mad flava in ya ear {...kick it down!}

funk smoke that leaves your brains booted
this bad m.c.
with stamina like bruce jenner(3)
the winner
tasting m.c.'s for dinner
you're crazy like that glue  {...you're crazy, boy, you're crazy.}

no flav 
could ever dig a grave
for the mack
the power pack
in black
makin' cement crack  {...make it crack...}
