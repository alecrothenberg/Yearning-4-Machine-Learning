i always seen you, just before the dawn
when all the other kids, where just draggin' along
i couldn't believe the way it seemed to be
rememberin' the things, you used to say to me

(about)
you know i can't be wastin' time
cause gotta get my fun
i got to keep on movin'
can't stop 'til it's all done

listen when i tell ya, you got no time for fix
cause i just gotta make it, can't afford to miss
and there's one reason, i'm tellin' you this
i feels bad
and i'm lookin' for a kiss

why wontcha tell me, why those kids are movin' so slow
is it just because they don't have no place to go
when the day starts breakin', the sun is gonna shine
it's hard to sleep, when i been cryin'

(and)
all you ladies are on
your way to church
(i'm beggin')
will i just be a' roamin'
lookin' turn to a search

listen when i tell ya, you got no time for fix
cause i just gotta make it, can't afford to miss
and there's one reason, i'm tellin' you this
i feels bad
and i'm lookin' for a kiss

well i been lookin' for a real hot kiss

you think it's bad, but you know that it's true
so why don't let me live baby
when i'm lookin' for a kiss
when everyone goes to your house, they shoot up in your room
most of them are beautiful, but so obsessed with gloom

i ain't gonna be here, when they all get home
they're always lookin' at me, they won't leave me alone
i didn't come here, lookin' for no fix
(i know)
i been houndin' the street all night late baby
justa lookin' for a kiss

i need fix and a kiss

i didn't come here, lookin' for no fix
(i know)
i been haulin' booty, all night long
just lookin' for a kiss
 i always seen you, just before the dawn
when all the other kids, where just draggin' along
i couldn't believe the way it seemed to be
rememberin' the things, you used to say to me

(about)
