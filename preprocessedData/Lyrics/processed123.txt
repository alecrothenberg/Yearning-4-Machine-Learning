come up screaming
come up screaming
i've never seen you look like this without a reason
another promise fallen through
another season passes by you
i never took the smile away from anybody's face
and that's a desperate way to look
for someone who is still a child

in a big country dreams stay with you
like a lover's voice fires the mountainside
stay alive

i thought that pain and truth were things that really mattered
but you can't stay here with every single hope you had shattered
i'm not expecting to grow flowers in a desert
but i can live and breathe
and see the sun in wintertime

in a big country dreams stay with you
like a lover's voice fires the mountainside
stay alive
stay alive

so take that look out of here it doesn't fit you
because it's happened doesn't mean you've been discarded
pull up your head off the floor?come up screaming
cry out for everything you ever might have wanted
i thought that pain and truth were things that really mattered
but you can't stay here with every single hope you had shattered
i'm not expecting to grow flowers in a desert
but i can live and breathe
and see the sun in wintertime

in a big country dreams stay with you
