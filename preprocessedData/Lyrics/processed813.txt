friday morning
thursday night
far from sleep
i'm still up and driving
can't go home obviously
so i'll just change direction
'cause they'll soon know where i live
and i wanna live
got a full tank and some chips
it was me and a gun and a man on my back
and i sang 'holy holy' as he buttoned down his pants
you can laugh
it's kinda funny
the things you think at times like these
like i haven't seen barbados
so i must get out of this

yes, i wore a slinky red thing
does that mean i should spread
for you
your friends
your father
mr. ed
it's me and a gun and a man on my back
but i haven't seen barbados
so i must get out of this

i know what this means
me and jesus a few years back
used to hang
and he said "it's your choice, babe
just remember
i don't think you'll be back
in 3 days time
so you choose well"
tell me what's right
is it my right
to be on my stomach
of fred's seville
it's me and a gun and a man on my back
but i haven't seen barbados
so i must get out of this

and do you know carolina
where the biscuits are soft and sweet
these things that go through your head
when there's a man on your back
and you're pushed flat on your stomach
it's not a classic cadillac
it's me and a gun and a man on my back
and i haven't seen barbados
so i must get out of this
