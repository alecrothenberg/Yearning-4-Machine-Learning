once i had a love and it was a gas
soon turned out had a heart of glass
seemed like the real thing, only to find
mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

once i had a love and it was divine
soon found out i was losing my mind
it seemed like the real thing but i was so blind
mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

in between
what i find is pleasing and i'm feeling fine
love is so confusing there's no peace of mind
if i fear i'm losing you it's just no good
you teasing like you do

once i had a love and it was a gas
soon turned out had a heart of glass
seemed like the real thing, only to find
mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

lost inside
adorable illusion and i cannot hide
i'm the one you're using, please don't push me aside
we coulda made it cruising, yeah

yeah, riding high on love's true bluish light

once i had a love and it was a gas
soon turned out to be a pain in the ass
seemed like the real thing only to find
mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
