here comes my guy walking down the street
look how he walks with a dancing beat
thick wavy hair, a little too long
all day long he's singing his song
and when i see him in the street
my heart takes a leap and skips a beat
gonna walk right up to him
give him a great big kiss
tell him that i love him
tell him that i care
tell him that i'll always be there

(spoken) well what color are his eyes?
i don't know he's always wearing shades
is he tall? well, i've got to look up
yeah? well i hear he's bad
mm, he's good bad, but he's not evil

tell me more, tell me more
big bulky sweaters to match his eyes
dirty fingernails
oh boy what a prize
tight tapered pants, high button shoes
he's always looking like he's got the blues
and when i see him in the street
my heart takes a leap and skips a beat
gonna walk right up to him
give him a great big kiss
tell him that i love him
tell him that i care
tell him that i'll always be therehere comes my guy walking down the street
