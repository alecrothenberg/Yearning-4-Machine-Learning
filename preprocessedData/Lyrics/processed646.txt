sunshine came softly through my a-window today
could've tripped out easy a-but i've a-changed my ways
it'll take time, i know it but in a while
you're gonna be mine, i know it, we'll do it in style
'cause i made my mind up you're going to be mine

i'll tell you right now
any trick in the book now, baby, all that i can find
everybody's hustlin' just to have a little scene
when i say we'll be cool i think that you know what i mean
we stood on a beach at sunset, do you remember when?
i know a beach where, baby, a-it never ends
when you've made your mind up forever to be mine

hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
i'll pick up your hand and slowly blow your little mind
'cause i made my mind up you're going to be mine
i'll tell you right now
any trick in the book now, baby, all that i can find

superman or green lantern ain't got a-nothin' on me
i can make like a turtle and dive for your pearls in the sea, yeah!
a you-you-you can just sit there a-thinking on your velvet throne
'bout all the rainbows a-you can a-have for your own
when you've made your mind up forever to be mine
i'll pick up your hand and slowly blow your little mind
when you've made your mind up forever to be mine

i'll pick up your hand
i'll pick up your hand
