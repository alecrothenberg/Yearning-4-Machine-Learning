you may be sweet and nice

but that won't keep you warm at night

'cause i'm the one who showed you how to do the things you're doing now

he may feel all your charms

he may hold you in his arms

but i'm the one who let you in 

i was right beside you then



once upon a time you let me feel you deep inside

and nobody knew and nobody saw

do you remember the way you cried

i'm your toy i'm your old boy

but i don't want no-one but you

to love me no i wouldn't lie

you know i'm that kind of guyyou may be sweet and nice

but that won't keep you warm at night

'cause i'm the one who showed you how to do the things you're doing now

he may feel all your charms

he may hold you in his arms
