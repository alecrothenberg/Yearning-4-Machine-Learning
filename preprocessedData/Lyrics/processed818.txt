when i look in the mirror
i can't believe what i see
tell me, who's that funky dude
staring back at me
broken, beaten down
can't even get around
without an old-man cane
i fall and hit the ground
shivering in the cold
i'm bitter and alone 

excuse the bitching
i shouldn't complain
i should have no feeling
cos feeling is pain
as everything i need
is denied me
and everything i want
is taken away from me
but who do i got to blame?
nobody but me 

and i don't wanna be an old man anymore
it's been a year or two since i was out on the floor
shaking booty, making sweet love all the night
it's time i got back to the good life
it's time i got back, it's time i got back
and i don't even know how i got off the track
i wanna go back, yeah! 

screw this crap, i've had it!
i ain't no mr. cool
i'm a pig, i'm a dog
so excuse me if i drool
i ain't gonna hurt nobody
ain't gonna cause a scene
just need to admit
that i want sugar in my tea
hear me (hear me) i want sugar in my tea! 

i don't wanna be an old man anymore
