i saw her sitting in the rain
raindrops falling on her
she didn't seem to care
she sat there and smiled at me

then i knew 
(i knew... i knew... i knew... i knew)
she could make me happy 
(happy... happy)
(she could make me very happy)
flowers in her hair 
(in her hair)
flowers everywhere 
(everywhere)

(i love the flower girl)
oh i don't know just why; she simply caught my eye
(i love the flower girl)
she seemed so sweet and kind; she crept into my mind
(to my mind... to my mind)

i knew i had to say hello 
(hello... hello)
she smiled up at me
and she took my hand and we walked through the park alone

and i knew 
(i knew... i knew... i knew... i knew)
she had made me happy 
(happy... happy)
(she had made me very happy)
flowers in her hair
 (in her hair)
flowers everywhere 
(everywhere)

(i love the flower girl)
oh i don't know just why; she simply caught my eye
(i love the flower girl)
she seemed so sweet and kind; she crept into my mind
(to my mind ... to my mind)

suddenly, the sun broke through
(see the sun)
i turned around she was gone
(where did she go)
and all i had left was one little flower in my hand

but i knew 
(i knew... i knew... i knew... i knew)
she had made me happy 
(happy... happy)
(she had made me very happy)
flowers in her hair 
(in her hair)
flowers everywhere 
(everywhere)

(i love the flower girl)
was she reality or just a dream to me
(i love the flower girl)
her love showed me the way to find a sunny day
(sunny day... sunny day... sunny day)

(i love the flower girl)
was she reality or just a dream to me...pd.
