a court is in session, a verdict is in,
no appeal on the docket today,
just my own sin,

the walls cold and pale,
the cage made of steel,
screams fill the room,
alone i drop and kneel,

(and i said oh) so i held my head up high,
hiding hate that burns inside,
which only fuels their selfish pride,

(and i said oh) all held captive,
out from the sun,
a sun that shines on only some,
we the meek are all in one,

i hear a thunder in the distance,
see a vision of a cross,
i feel the pain that was given,
on that sad day of loss,

a lion roars in the darkness,
only he holds the key,
a light to free me from my burden,
and grant me life eternally,

should have been dead,
on a sunday morning,
banging my head,
no time for mourning,
ain't got no time.

out from the sun,
a sun that shines on only some,
we the meek are all in one,

i cry out to god,
seeking only his decision,
gabriel stands and confirms,
i've created my own prison.
