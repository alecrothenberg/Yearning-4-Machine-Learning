they say that these are not the best of times
but they're the only time i've ever known
and i believe there is a time for meditation
in cathedrals of your own
now i've seen that sad surrender in my lover's eyes
and i can only stand apart and sympathize
for we are always what our situations hand us
it's either sadness or euphoria

so we'll argue and we'll compromise
and realize that nothing's ever changed
for all our mutual experience
our separate conclusions are the same
now we are forced to recognize our inhumanity
and reason coexist with our insanity
and our reason coexist with our insanity
it's either sadness or euphoria

how thoughtlessly we dissipate our energies
perhaps we don't fulfill each other's fantasies
and as we stand upon the ledges of our lives
with our respective similarities
it's either sadness or euphoria
