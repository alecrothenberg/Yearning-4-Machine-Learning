hey, little girl in the high school sweater
gee, but i'd like to know you better,
just a-swingin' your books and chewin' gum,
lookin' just like a juicy plum,
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, little girl.

hey, little girl in the black silk stockin's
gee, but you got my heart rockin',
a-wearin' that crazy skin-tight skirt and that crazy ivy league shirt
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, little girl.

hey, little girl, can i come along?
carry your books; and a-hold your arm?
i'm hopin' that you'll tell me yes, because you're the girl that i love best
hey, hey, hey, hey
hey, hey, hey, mm-mm

hey, little girl in the high school sweater
gee, i hope you're feelin' better
not just like the time before, 'member when you closed that door?
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, little girl
