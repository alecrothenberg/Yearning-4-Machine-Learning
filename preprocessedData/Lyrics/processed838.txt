hey hey,the clouds are whey, 
there's straw for the donkeys 
and the innocents can all sleep safely 
all sleep safely. 

my my, sun is pie 
there's fodder for the cannons 
and the guilty ones can all sleep safely 
all sleep safely. 

and all the world is football shaped, 
it's just for me to kick in space 
and i can see, hear, smell, touch, taste 
and i've got one, two, three, four, five senses working overtime 
trying to take this all in, 
i've got one, two, three, four, five senses working overtime 
trying to taste the difference 'tween the lemons and limes 
the pain and the pleasure and 
the church bells softly chime... 

hey hey, night fights day, 
there's food for the thinkers 
and the innocents can all live slowly 
all live slowly 
my, my the sky will cry 
jewels for the thirsty and the guilty ones can 
all die slowly all die slowly. 
and all the world is biscuit shaped, 
it's just for me to feed my face 
and i can see,hear, smell, touch, taste
and i've got one, two,three, four, five sense working overtime 
trying to take this all in, 
i've got one, two, three, four, five senses working overtime 
trying to taste the difference 'tween the lemons and limes 
the pain and the pleasure and the church bells softly chime...

and birds might fall from black skies 
and bullies might give you black eyes 
and buses might skid on black ice 
but to me it's very very beautiful (england's glory!) 
beautiful (a striking beauty!) 
and all the world is football - shaped, 
it's just for me to kick in space 
and i can see, hear, smell, touch, taste - 
and i've got one,two,three,four,five senses working overtime 
trying to take this all in, 
i've got one,two,three, four,five senses working overtime 
try to tell the difference 'tween the goods and crimes, 
dirt or treasure and there's 
one, two, three, four,five senses working overtime 
trying to take this all in, 
i've got one, two, three, four, five senses working overtime 
trying to taste the difference 'tween the lemons and limes 
the pain and the pleasure and the church bells softly chime...
