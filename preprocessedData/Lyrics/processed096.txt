well, it's saturday night and i just got paid,
fool about my money, don't try to save,
my heart says go go, have a time,
saturday night and i'm feelin' fine,

[chorus:]
i'm gonna rock it up, i'm gonna rip it up,
i'm gonna shake it up, gonna ball it up,
i'm gonna rock it up, and ball tonight.

got me a date and i won't be late,
picked her up in my 88,
shag on down by the union hall,
when the joint starts jumpin' i'll have a ball,
i'm gonna rock it up, ...

[chorus]

'long about ten i'll be flying high,
walk on out unto the sky,
but i don't care if i spend my dough,
'cause tonight i'm gonna be one happy soul,
i'm gonna rock it up, ...

[chorus]
