looking out on the morning rain
i used to feel uninspired
and when i knew i had to face another day
lord, it made me feel so tired
before the day i met you, life was so unkind
but you were the key to my peace of mind

'cause you make me feel, 
you make me feel, 
you make me feel like
a natural woman

when my soul was in the lost-and-found
you came along to claim it
i didn't know just what was wrong with me
till your kiss helped me name it
now i'm no longer doubtful of what i'm living for
'cause if i make you happy i don't need no more

'cause you make me feel, 
you make me feel, 
you make me feel like
a natural woman

oh, baby, what you've done to me
you make me feel so good inside
and i just want to be close to you
you make me fell so alive

'cause you make me feel, 
you make me feel, 
you make me feel like
a natural woman
