you'd never leave on your own
where you're from and where you're going
i know these things like i know you hate me now
catch yourself in mid-air thinking
your dreams can never be bought
i couldn't help you then and i guess i can't help you now
when jousting is for pleasure
pleasure is way out of hand
the time is right for getting out while we still can
chickamauga's where i've been
solitude is where i'm bound
i don't ever want to taste these tears again
i don't ever want to taste these tears again
appalachian, so patient
the lessons we've traveled
as soon as we're out we're kicking our way back in
fighting fire with unlit matches
from our respective trenches
no authority can clean up this mess we're in
a miracle might point the way
to solutions we're after
and avert our chronic impending disaster
