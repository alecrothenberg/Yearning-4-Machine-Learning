new york, new york is everything they say
and no place that i'd rather be
where else can you do a half a million things
and all at a quarter to three
when they play their music, ooh that modern music
the like it with a lot of style
but it's still that same old back beat rhythm
that really drives them wild

[chorus]
they say the heart of rock and roll is still beating
and from what i've seen i believe 'em
now the old boy may be barely breathing
but the heart of rock and roll is still beating

l.a., hollywood and the sunset strip is something everyone should see
neon lights and the pretty, pretty girls all dressed so scantily
when they play their music, that hard rock music
they like it with a lot of flash
but it's still that same old back beat rhythm
that really kicks 'em in the

[chorus]

d.c., san antone and the liberty town, boston and baton rouge
tulsa, austin, oklahoma city, seattle, san francisco, too
everywhere there's music, real live music, bands with a million styles
but it's still that same old rock and roll music that really drives 'em wild

[chorus]

in cleveland
detroit, heart of rock and roll
 new york, new york is everything they say
and no place that i'd rather be
where else can you do a half a million things

the like it with a lot of style
but it's still that same old back beat rhythm
that really drives them wild
