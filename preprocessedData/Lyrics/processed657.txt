history never repeats
i tell myself before i go to sleep
don't say the words you might regret
i lost before, you know i can't forget

there was a girl i used to know
she dealt my love a savage blow
i was so young, too blind to see
but anyway that's history

i say history never repeats
i tell myself before i go to sleep
don't say the words you might regret
i lost before, you know i can't forget

you say i always play the fool
i can't go on if that's the rule
better to jump than hesitate
i need a change and i can't wait

history never repeats
i tell myself before i go to sleep
and there's a light shining in the dark
leading me on towards a change of heart, ah

history never repeats
history never repeats

deep in the night it's all so clear
i lie awake with great ideas
lurking about in no-man's land
i think at last i understand

history never repeats
i tell myself before i go to sleep
and there's a light shining in the dark
leading me on towards a change of heart, ah

never repeats
