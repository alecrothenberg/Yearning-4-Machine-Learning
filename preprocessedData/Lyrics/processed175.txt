ooh wah, ooh wah cool, cool kitty
tell us about the boy from new york city
ooh wah, ooh wah c'mon kitty
tell us about the boy from new york city

he's kind of tall
he's really fine
some day i hope to make him mine, all mine
and he's neat
and oh so sweet
and just the way he looked at me
he swept me off my feet
ooh whee, you ought to come and see
how he walks
and how he talks

ooh wah, ooh wah cool, cool kitty
tell us about the boy from new york city

he's really down
and he's no clown
he has the finest penthouse i've ever seen in town
and he's cute
in his mohair suit
and he keeps his pockets full of spending loot
ooh whee, say you ought to come and see
his dueling scar
and brand new car

every time he says he loves me
chills run down my spine
every time he wants to kiss me
he makes me feel so fine
ooh wah, ooh wah cool, cool kitty
tell us about the boy from new york city

well he can dance (he can dance, take a chance with a little)
and make romance (romance baby, cause he's a looker)
that's when i feel in love 
with just one glance (he's sweet talking and cool)

he was shy 
and so was i
and now i know i'll never, ever say goodbye
ooh whee, say you ought to come and see
he's the most
from coast to coast
