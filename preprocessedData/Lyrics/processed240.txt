all of my love

all of my kissin'

you don't know what you've been a-missin'

oh boy, when you're with me

oh boy, the world can see

that you, were meant, for me



all of my life

i've been a-waitin'

tonight there'll be no, hesitatin'

oh boy, when you're with me

oh boy, the world can see

that you, were meant, for me



stars appear and shadows are falling

you can hear my heart a-calling

a little bit a-lovin' makes everything right

i'm gonna see my baby tonight
