hey, everybody, let's have some fun
you only live but once
and when you're dead you're done, so
let the good times roll, let the good times roll
i don't care if you're young or old
get together, let the good times roll

don't sit there mumblin', talkin' trash
if you wanna have a ball
you gotta go out and spend some cash, and
let the good times roll, let the good times roll
i don't care if you're young or old
get together, let the good times roll

hey mr. landlord, lock up all the doors
when the police comes around
just tell 'em that the joint is closed
let the good times roll, let the good times roll
i don't care if you're young or old
go out and let the good times roll

hey oh, tell everybody
mr. john's in town
i got a dollar and a quarter
just rarin' to clown
but don't let nobody play me cheap
i got fifty cents more that i'm gonna keep, so
let the good times roll, let the good times roll
i don't care if you're young or old
get together, let the good times roll

no matter whether rainy weather
birds of a feather gotta stick together
so get yourself under control
go out and get together and let the good times roll
