a-tisket a-tasket
a green and yellow basket
i bought a basket for my mommie
on the way i dropped it
i dropped it, i dropped it
yes on the way i dropped it
a little girlie picked it up
and took it to the market
she was truckin' on down the 
avenue without a single thing to do
she was peck, peck, peckin' all around
when she spied it on the ground
a-tisket a-tasket
she took my yellow basket 
and if she doesn't bring it back
i think that i shall die
(was it red?)
no, no, no, no
(was it brown?)
no, no, no, no
(was it blue)
no, no, no, no
just a little yellow basket
