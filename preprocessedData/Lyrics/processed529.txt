look for me another day.
i feel that i could change,
i feel that i could change.
there's a sudden joy that's like
a fish, a moving light;
i thought i saw it
rowing on the lakes of canada

oh laughing man, what have you won?
don't tell me what cannot be done.
my little mouth, my winter lungs,
don't tell me what cannot be done,
cannot be done.

walking in the circle of a flashlight
someone starts to sing, to join in.
talk of loneliness in quiet voices.
i am shy but you can reach me.
rowing on the lakes of canada,
rowing on the lakes of canada.

oh laughing man, what have you won?
don't tell me what cannot be done.
my little mouth, my winter lungs,
don't tell me what can't be done.

look for me another time
give me another day
i feel that i could change

rowing on the lakes of canada
 look for me another day.
i feel that i could change,
i feel that i could change.
there's a sudden joy that's like
a fish, a moving light;
i thought i saw it
rowing on the lakes of canada

oh laughing man, what have you won?
don't tell me what cannot be done.
my little mouth, my winter lungs,
don't tell me what cannot be done,
cannot be done.

walking in the circle of a flashlight
someone starts to sing, to join in.
talk of loneliness in quiet voices.
i am shy but you can reach me.
rowing on the lakes of canada,
rowing on the lakes of canada.

oh laughing man, what have you won?
don't tell me what cannot be done.
my little mouth, my winter lungs,
don't tell me what can't be done.

look for me another time
give me another day
i feel that i could change

rowing on the lakes of canada
 look for me another day.
i feel that i could change,
i feel that i could change.
there's a sudden joy that's like

i thought i saw it
rowing on the lakes of canada

oh laughing man, what have you won?
