well i saw the thing comin' out of the sky 
it had the one long horn, one big eye 
i commenced to shakin' and i said "ooh-eee" 
it looks like a purple eater to me 

it was a one-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater 
(one-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater) 
a one-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater 
sure looks strange to me (one eye?) 

well he came down to earth and he lit in a tree 
i said mr. purple people eater, don't eat me 
i heard him say in a voice so gruff 
i wouldn't eat you cuz you're so tough 

it was a one-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater 
one-eyed, one-horned flyin' purple people eater 
one-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater 
sure looks strange to me (one horn?) 

i said mr. purple people eater, what's your line 
he said it's eatin' purple people and it sure is fine 
but that's not the reason that i came to land 
i wanna get a job in a rock and roll band 

well bless my soul, rock and roll, flyin' purple people eater 
pigeon-toed, undergrowed, flyin' purple people eater 
(we wear short shorts) 
flyin' purple people eater 
sure looks strange to me 

and then he swung from the tree and he lit on the ground 
he started to rock, really rockin' around 
it was a crazy ditty with a swingin' tune 
sing a boop boop aboopa lopa lum bam boom 

well bless my soul, rock and roll, flyin' purple people eater 
pigeon-toed, undergrowed, flyin' purple people eater 
i like short shorts 
flyin' little people eater 
sure looks strange to me (purple people?) 

and then he went on his way, and then what do ya know 
i saw him last night on a tv show 
he was blowing it out a really knockin' em dead
playing rock and roll music through the horn in his headwell i saw the thing comin' out of the sky
