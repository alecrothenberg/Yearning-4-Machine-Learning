i can see her lyin' back in her satin dress
in a room where ya do what ya don't confess
sundown ya better take care
if i find you bin creepin' 'round my back stairs
sundown ya better take care
if i find you bin creepin' 'round my back stairs

she's bin lookin' like a queen in a sailor's dream
and she don't always say what she really means
sometimes i think it's a shame
when i get feelin' better when i'm feelin' no pain
sometimes i think it's a shame
when i get feelin' better when i'm feelin' no pain

i can picture every move that a man could make
getting lost in her lovin' is your first mistake
sundown ya better take care
if i find you bin creepin' 'round my back stairs
sometimes i think it's a sin
when i feel like i'm winnin' when i'm losin' again

i can see her lookin' fast in her faded jeans
she's a hard lovin' woman, got me feelin' mean
sometimes i think it's a shame
when i get feelin' better when i'm feelin' no pain
sundown ya better take care
if i find you bin creepin' 'round my back stairs
sundown ya better take care
if i find you bin creepin' 'round my back stairs
