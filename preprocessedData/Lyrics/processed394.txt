been feeling high, and then feeling low
just strap your hands across my engines
i'm not broke so please don't mend me
you're like a neon sign, just burn so bright
penetrates like an infection
gives me feelings i can't mention

maybe all i need, you need too
don't wait for me, i'll wait for you

i'm gonna follow you around
i'm gonna wear you down
i don't want to alienate you
you've got as long as it might take you
things come in ones, and double up to two
don't wanna rain on your procession
only seeking your obsession

maybe all i need, you need too
don't wait for me, i'll wait for you

might take a little time
got all the time we need
i'm not here to try and fool you
just trying to break on through you
that wasn't right, but then's nothings wrong
i've got a feeling it's all right
i gotta keep you in my sights

maybe all i need, you need too
don't wait for me, i'll wait for you

maybe all i need, you need too,
don't wait for me, i'll wait for you

don't wait for me, i'll wait for you
