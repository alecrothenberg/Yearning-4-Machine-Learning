come a little bit closer
hear what i have to say
just like children sleepin'
we could dream this night away.

but there's a full moon risin'
let's go dancin' in the light
we know where the music's playin'
let's go out and feel the night.

because i'm still in love with you
i want to see you dance again
because i'm still in love with you
on this harvest moon.

when we were strangers
i watched you from afar
when we were lovers
i loved you with all my heart.

but now it's gettin' late
and the moon is climbin' high
i want to celebrate
see it shinin' in your eye.

because i'm still in love with you
i want to see you dance again
because i'm still in love with you
on this harvest moon.
