i am an old woman
named after my mother
my old man's another
child that's grown old
if dreams were lightnin'
and thunder were desire
this old house would've burned down
a long time ago

make me an angel
that flies from montgomery
make me a poster
of an old rodeo
just give me one thing 
that i can hold onto
to believe in this livin'
is such a hard way to go

when i was a young girl
i had me a cowboy
weren't much to look at
just a free ramblin' man
but that was a long time
and no matter how i try
the years just flow by
like a broken down dam

make me an angel
that flies from montgomery
make me a poster
of an old rodeo
just give me one thing 
that i can hold onto
to believe in this livin'
is such a hard way to go

there's flies in the kitchen
i can hear 'em in there buzzin'
and i ain't done nothin'
since i woke up today
how the hell can a person
go to work in the mornin'
and come home in the evenin'
and have nothin' to say

make me an angel
that flies from montgomery
make me a poster
of an old rodeo
just give me one thing 
that i can hold onto
to believe in this livin'
is such a hard way to go
