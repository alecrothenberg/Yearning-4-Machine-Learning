maybe i didn't treat you
quite as good as i should have
maybe i didn't love you
quite as often as i could have
little things i should've said and done
i just never took the time

but you were always on my mind
you were always on my mind

maybe i didn't hold you
all those lonely, lonely times
i guess i never told you
that i am so happy that you're mine
if i made you feel second best
i'm so sorry i was blind

but you were always on my mind
you were always on my mind

tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
give me, give me one more chance
to keep you satisfied
i'll keep you satisfied

little things i should have said and done
i just never took the time
but you were always on my mind
you were always on my mind  [repeat: x3]
