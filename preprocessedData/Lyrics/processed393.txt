guess i got what i deserved
kept you waiting there too long, my love
all that time without a word
didn't know you'd think that i'd forget or i'd regret
the special love i had for you, my baby blue

all the days became so long
did you really think, i'd do you wrong?
dixie, when i let you go
thought you'd realize that i would know
i would show the special love i have for you, my baby blue

what can i do, what can i say
except i want you by my side
how can i show you, show me the way
don't you know the times i've tried?

[guitar solo (joey molland)]

guess that's all i have to say
except the feeling just grows stronger every day
just one thing before i go
take good care, baby, let me know, let it grow
the special love you have for me, my dixie, dear.
