yeh, it goes away
all of this and more of nothing in my life
no color clay
individuality not safe

as of now i bet you got me wrong
so unsure you run from something strong

i can't let go
threadbare tapestry unwinding slow
feel a tortured brain
show your belly like you want me to

as of now i bet you got me wrong
so unsure you run from something strong

i haven't felt like this in so long
wrong, in a sense too far gone from love
that don't last forever
something's gotta turn out right

you sugar taste
sweetness doesn't often touch my face
stay if you please
you may not be here when i leave

as of now i bet you got me wrong
so unsure we reach for something strong

i haven't felt like this in so long
wrong, in a sense too far gone from love
strong, i haven't felt like this in so long
wrong, in a sense too far gone from love
that don't last forever
something's gotta turn out right
 yeh, it goes away
all of this and more of nothing in my life
no color clay
individuality not safe

as of now i bet you got me wrong
