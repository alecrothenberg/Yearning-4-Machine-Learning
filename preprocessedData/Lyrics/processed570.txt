the beat goes on, the beat goes on
drums keep pounding
a rhythm to the brain
la de da de de, la de da de da

charleston was once the rage, uh huh
history has turned the page, uh huh
the mini skirts the current thing, uh huh
teenybopper is our newborn king, uh huh

[chorus]

the grocery store's the super mart, uh huh
little girls still break their hearts, uh huh
and men still keep on marching off to war
electrically they keep a baseball score

[chorus]

grandmas sit in chairs and reminisce
boys keep chasing girls to get a kiss
the cars keep going faster all the time
bums still cry, "hey buddy,
have you got a dime?"

[chorus]
 the beat goes on, the beat goes on
drums keep pounding
a rhythm to the brain
la de da de de, la de da de da
