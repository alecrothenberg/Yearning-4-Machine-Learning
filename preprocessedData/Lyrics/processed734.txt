some of buddy holly, the working folly
good golly miss molly and boats
hammersmith palais, the bolshoi ballet
jump back in the alley add nanny goats

18-wheeler scammels, thumbing out the candles
all other mammals must eat their oats.
seeing piccadilly, fanny smith and willy
being rather silly, and porridge oats

a bit of grin and bear it, a bit of come and share it
you're welcome, we can spare it - yellow socks
too short to be haughty, too nutty to be naughty
going on 40 - no electric shocks

the juice of the carrot, the smile of the parrot
a little drop of claret - anything that rocks
elvis and scotty, days when i ain't spotty,
sitting on the potty - curing small pox
