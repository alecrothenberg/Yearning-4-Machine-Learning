there is freedom within, there is freedom without
try to catch the deluge in a paper cup
there's a battle ahead, many battles are lost
but you'll never see the end of the road
while you're travelling with me
hey now, hey now
don't dream it's over
hey now, hey now
when the world comes in
they come, they come
to build a wall between us
we know they won't win
now i'm towing my car, there's a hole in the roof
my possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof
in the paper today tales of war and of waste
but you turn right over to the t.v. page
hey now, hey now
don't dream it's over
hey now, hey now
when the world comes in
they come, they come
to build a wall between us
we know they won't win
now i'm walking again to the beat of a drum
and i'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
only shadows ahead barely clearing the roof
get to know the feeling of liberation and release
hey now, hey now
don't dream it's over
hey now, hey now
when the world comes in
they come, they come
to build a wall between us
we know they won't win
don't let them win
(hey now, hey now)
