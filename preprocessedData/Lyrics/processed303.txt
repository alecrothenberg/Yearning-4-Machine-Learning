it's knowing that your door is always open
and your path is free to walk
that makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag
rolled up and stashed behind your couch
and it's knowing i'm not shackled
by forgotten words and bonds
and the ink stains that have dried upon some line
that keeps you in the backroads
by the rivers of my mem'ry
that keeps you ever gentle on my mind

it's not clinging to the rocks and ivy
planted on their columns now that binds me
or something that somebody said
because they thought we fit together walking
it's just knowing that the world will not be cursing
or forgiving when i walk along some railroad track and find 
that you are moving on the backroads
by the rivers of my mem'ry
and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
and the junkyards and the highways come between us
and some other woman crying to her mother
'cause she turned and i was gone
i still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
and the summer sun might burn me 'til i'm blind
but not to where i cannot see you walkin' on the backroads
by the rivers flowing gentle on my mind

i dip my cup of soup back from the gurglin'
cracklin' caldron in some train yard
my beard a roughning coal pile and
a dirty hat pulled low across my face
through cupped hands 'round a tin can
i pretend i hold you to my breast and find
that you're waving from the backroads
by the rivers of my mem'ry
ever smilin' ever gentle on my mind
 it's knowing that your door is always open
and your path is free to walk
that makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag
rolled up and stashed behind your couch
and it's knowing i'm not shackled
by forgotten words and bonds
and the ink stains that have dried upon some line
that keeps you in the backroads
by the rivers of my mem'ry
