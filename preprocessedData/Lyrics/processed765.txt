you're into japanese fast food
and i drop you off with your japanese lover
and you go to the beach all day
you're so pretty when you're unfaithful to me
you're so pretty when you're unfaithful to me

you're looking like
you've got some sun
your blistered lips
have got a kiss
the days are lit like everyone
uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh

your bones got a little machine
you're the bone machine

i was talking to preachy-preach about kissy-kiss
buy me a soda
buy me a soda and try to molest me in the parking lot
eh, eh

i make you break
you make me hard
your irish skin
looks mexican
our love is rice and beans and horse's lard
your bones got a little machine
you're the bone machine

uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh  [3x]
uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh
