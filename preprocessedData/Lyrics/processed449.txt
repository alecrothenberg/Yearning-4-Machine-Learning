doctor, my eyes have seen the years
and the slow parade of fears without crying
now i want to understand
i have done all that i could
to see the evil and the good without hiding
you must help me if you can
doctor, my eyes
tell me what is wrong
was i unwise to leave them open for so long
'cause i have wandered through this world
and as each moment has unfurled
i've been waiting to awaken from these dreams
people go just where there will
i never noticed them until i got this feeling
that it's later than it seems
doctor, my eyes
tell me what you see
i hear their cries
just say if it's too late for me
doctor, my eyes
cannot see the sky
is this the prize for having learned how not to cry
