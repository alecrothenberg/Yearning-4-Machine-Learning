i don't need anyone
don't need no mom and dad
don't need no pretty face
don't need no human race
i got some news for you
don't even need you too

i got my devil machine
got my electronic dream
sonic reducer
ain't no loser
i'm a sonic reducer
ain't no loser

people out on the streets
they don't know who i am
i watch them from my room
they all just pass me by
but i'm not just anyone
said i'm not just anyone

i got my devil machine
got my electronic dream
sonic reducer 
ain't no loser
i'm a sonic reducer
ain't no loser

i'll be a pharaoh soon
rule from some golden tomb
things will be different then
the sun will rise from here
then i'll be ten feet tall
and you'll be nothing at all
 i don't need anyone
don't need no mom and dad
don't need no pretty face
don't need no human race
i got some news for you
don't even need you too
