ev'rything is set, skies are blue,
can't believe it yet, but it's true, 
i'll give you just one guess, 
my sweet lorraine said "yes;"
waiting for the time, soon to be, 
when the bells will chime merrily,
 
(i'm so happy,)when it's raining i don't miss the sun, 
for it's in my sweeties smile,
just think that i'm the lucky one 
who will lend her down the aisle;
each night i pray 
that nobody steals her heart away, 
just can't wait until that happy day,
when i mary sweet lorraine.
