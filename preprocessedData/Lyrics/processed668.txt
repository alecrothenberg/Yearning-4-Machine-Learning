winchester cathedral
you're bringing me down
you stood and you watched as
my baby left town

you could have done something
but you didn't try
you didn't do nothing
you let her walk by

now everyone knows just how much i needed that gal
she wouldn't have gone far away
if only you'd started ringing your bell

my baby left town

oh-bo-de-o-do oh-bo-de-o-do
oh-bo-de-o-do de-do- duh
