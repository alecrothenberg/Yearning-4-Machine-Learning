talkin' to myself and feeling old.

sometimes i'd like to quit;

nothing ever seems to fit;

hangin' around, nothing to do but frown;

rainy days and mondays always get me down



what i've got they used to call the blues:

nothin' is really wrong;

feelin' like i don't belong;

walkin' around, some kind of lonely clown;

rainy days and mondays always get me down



funny, but it seems that i always wind up-a here with you;

nice to know somebody loves me.

funny, but it seems that it's the only thing to do:

run and find the one who loves me.



(*) what i feel is come and gone before:

no need to talk it out;

we know what it's all about.

hangin' around, nothing to do but frown;

rainy days and mondays always get me down



funny but it seems that it's the only thing to do,

run and find the one who loves me



repeat (*)



hangin' around, nothing do to but frown;

rainy days and mondays always get me down
 talkin' to myself and feeling old.
