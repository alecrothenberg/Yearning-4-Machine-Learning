i fall to pieces
each time i see you again
i fall to pieces
how can i be just your friend

you want me to act
like we've never kissed
you want me to forget
pretend we've never met

and i try and i try
but i haven't yet
you walk by and i fall to pieces

i fall to pieces
each time someone speaks your name
i fall to pieces
time only adds to the pain

you tell me to find someone else to love
someone who loves me too
the way you used to do
but each time i go out with someone new
you walk by and i fall to pieces
 i fall to pieces
each time i see you again
i fall to pieces
how can i be just your friend

you want me to act
like we've never kissed
you want me to forget
pretend we've never met

and i try and i try
but i haven't yet
you walk by and i fall to pieces

i fall to pieces
each time someone speaks your name
i fall to pieces
time only adds to the pain

you tell me to find someone else to love
someone who loves me too
the way you used to do
but each time i go out with someone new
you walk by and i fall to pieces
 i fall to pieces
each time i see you again
i fall to pieces
how can i be just your friend

you want me to act
like we've never kissed
you want me to forget
pretend we've never met

and i try and i try
but i haven't yet
you walk by and i fall to pieces

i fall to pieces
each time someone speaks your name
i fall to pieces
time only adds to the pain

you tell me to find someone else to love

the way you used to do
