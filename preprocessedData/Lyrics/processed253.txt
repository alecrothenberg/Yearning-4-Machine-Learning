just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
any old way you choose it
it's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
any old time you use it
it's gotta be rock roll music
if you wanna dance with me
if you wanna dance with me
i've got no kick against modern jazz
unless they try to play it too darn fast
and lose the beauty of the melody
until they sound just like a symphony
that's why i go for that that rock and roll music
any old way you choose it
it's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
any old time you use it
it's gotta be rock roll music
if you wanna dance with me
if you wanna dance with me
i took my loved one over 'cross the tracks
so she can hear my man awail a sax
i must admit they have a rockin' band
man, they were blowin' like a hurrican'
that's why i go for that that rock and roll music
any old way you choose it
it's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
any old time you use it
it's gotta be rock roll music
if you wanna dance with me
if you wanna dance with me
way down south they had a jubilee
the jokey folks they had a jamboree
they're drinkin' home brew from a water cup
the folks dancin' there are all shook up
and started playin' that that rock and roll music
any old time you use it
it's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
any old time you use it
it's gotta be rock roll music
if you wanna dance with me
if you wanna dance with me
don't care to hear 'em play a tango
and in the mood they take a mambo
it's way to early for a congo
so keep a rockin' that piano
that's why i go for that that rock and roll music
any old time you use it
it's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
any old time you use it
it's gotta be rock roll music
if you wanna dance with me
if you wanna dance with me
 just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
