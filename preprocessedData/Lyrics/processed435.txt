karma police, arrest this man
he talks in math
he buzzes like a fridge
he's like a detuned radio

karma police, arrest this girl
her hitler hairdo
is making me feel ill
and we have crashed her party

this is what you get
this is what you get
this is what you get
when you mess with us

karma police, i've given all i can
it's not enough
i've given all i can
but we're still on the payroll

this is what you get
this is what you get

when you mess with us

i lost myself
