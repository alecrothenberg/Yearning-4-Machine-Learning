if i could save time in a bottle
the first thing that i'd like to do
is to save every day
'til eternity passes away
just to spend them with you

if i could make days last forever
if words could make wishes come true
i'd save every day like a treasure and then,
again, i would spend them with you

chorus:
  but there never seems to be enough time
  to do the things you want to do
  once you find them
  i've looked around enough to know
  that you're the one i want to go
  through time with

if i had a box just for wishes
and dreams that had never come true
the box would be empty
except for the memory
of how they were answered by you

(repeat chorus)
