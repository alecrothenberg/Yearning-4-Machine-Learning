they asked me how i knew my true love was true
i of course replied
"something here inside cannot be denied"
they said "someday you'll find
all who love are blind"
when your heart's on fire,
you must realize
smoke gets in your eyes

so i chaffed them and i gaily laughed
to think they could doubt my love
yet today my love has flown away,
i am without my love

now laughing friends deride tears i cannot hide
so i smile and say
"when a lovely flame dies,
smoke gets in your eyes"
