well i was born the coal miner's daughter in a cabin on a hill in butcher holler
we were poor but we had love that's the one thing that daddy made sure of
he shovel coal to make a poor man's dollar
my daddy worked all night in the vanleer coal mine all day long in the field hoein' corn
mommie rocked the baby that night and read the bible by the coal oil light
and everything would start all over come break of morn
daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay
mommie scrubbed our clothes on a washboard everyday
why i've seen her fingers bleed to complain there was no need
she's smiled in mommie's understanding way
in the summertime we didn't have shoes to wear
but in the wintertime we'd all get a brand new pair
from a mail order catalog money made by selling a hog
daddy always managed to get the money somewhere
yeah i'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter
i remember well the well where i drew water
the work we done was hard at night we'd sleep cause we were tired
i never thought i'd ever leave the butcher holler
but a lots of things have changed since the way back then
and it's so good to be back home again
not much left but the floor nothing lives there anymore
just the mem'ries of a coal miner's daughter
