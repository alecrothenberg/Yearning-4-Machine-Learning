when life is too much, roll with it, baby
don't stop and lose your touch, oh no, baby
hard times knocking on your door, i'll tell them you ain't there no more
get on through it, roll with it, baby
luck'll come and then slip away, you've gotta move, bring it back to stay

you just roll with it, baby, come on and just roll with it, baby
you and me, roll with it, baby, hang on and just roll with it, baby

the way that you love is good as money
i swear by stars above, sweet as honey
people think you're down and out, you show them what it's all about
you can make it, roll with it, baby
when this world turns its back on you, 
hang in and do that sweet thing you do

you just roll with it, baby, you just roll with it, baby
come on and just roll with it, baby, you and me, just roll with it, baby

now there'll be a day you'll get there, baby, you'll hear the music
play, you'll dance, baby
you'll leave bad times way behind, nothing but good times on your mind
you can do it, roll with it, baby
then you'll see life will be so nice, it's just a step up to paradise
you just roll with it, baby, you just roll with it, baby
you and me, just roll with it, baby, come on and just roll with it, baby
 when life is too much, roll with it, baby
don't stop and lose your touch, oh no, baby
hard times knocking on your door, i'll tell them you ain't there no more
get on through it, roll with it, baby
luck'll come and then slip away, you've gotta move, bring it back to stay

you just roll with it, baby, come on and just roll with it, baby
