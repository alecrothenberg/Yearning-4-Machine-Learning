i remember every little thing
as if it happened only yesterday
parking by the lake
and there was not another car in sight
and i never had a girl
looking any better than you did
and all the kids at school
they were wishing they were me that night
and now our bodies are oh so close and tight
it never felt so good, it never felt so right
and we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
c'mon! hold on tight!
c'mon! hold on tight!
thought it's cold and lonely in the deep dark night
i can see paradise by the dashboard light

ain't no doubt about it
we were doubly blessed
'cause we were barely seventeen
and we were barely dressed
ain't no doubt about it
baby got to go and shout it
ain't no doubt about it
we were doubly blessed

'cause we were barely dressed
and we were barely dressed
baby doncha hear my heart
you got it drowning out the radio
i've been waiting so long
for you to come along and have some fun
and i gotta let you know
no you're never gonna regret it
so open up your eyes i got a big surprise
it'll feel all right
well i want to make your motor run
and now our bodies are oh so close and tight
it never felt so good, it never felt so right
and we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
c'mon! hold on tight!
c'mon! hold on tight!
though it's cold and lonely in the deep dark night
i can see paradise by the dashboard light
paradise by the dashboard light
you got to do what you can
and let mother nature do the rest
ain't no doubt about it
we were doubly blessed
'cause we were barely seventeen
and we were barely-
we're gonna go all the way tonight
we're gonna go all the way
and tonight's the night

ok, here we go, we got a real pressure cooker going here, 
two down, nobody on, no score, bottom of the ninth, 
there's the windup, and there it is, 
a line shot up the middle, look at him go. 
this boy can really fly! 
he's rounding first and really turning it on now, 
he's not letting up at all, 
he's gonna try for second, the ball is bobbled out in center, 
and here comes the throw, and what a throw! 
he's gonna slide in head first, 
here he comes, he's out! 
no, wait, safe-safe at second base, 
this kid really makes things happen out there. 
batter steps up to the plate, here's the pitch-he's going, 
and what a jump he's got, he's trying for third, 
here's the throw, it's in the dirt-safe at third! 
holy cow, stolen base! he's taking a pretty big lead out there, 
almost daring him to try and pick him off. 
the pitcher glances over, winds up, and it's bunted, 
bunted down the third base line, the suicide squeeze is on! 
here he comes, squeeze play, it's gonna be close, 
holy cow, i think he's gonna make it!

stop right there!
i gotta know right now!
before we go any further!
do you love me?
will you love me forever?
do you need me?
will you never leave me?
will you make me so happy for the rest of my life?
will you take me away and will you make me your wife?
do you love me!?
will you love me forever?
do you need me!?
will you never leave me!?
will you make me happy for the rest of my life!?
will you take me away and will you make me your wife!?
i gotta know right now
before we go any further
do you love me!?
will you love me forever!?

let me sleep on it
baby, baby let me sleep on it
let me sleep on it
and i'll give you an answer in the morning
let me sleep on it
baby, baby let me sleep on it
let me sleep on it
and i'll give you an answer in the morning

i couldn't take it any longer
lord i was crazed
and when the feeling came upon me
like a tidal wave
i started swearing to my god and on my mother's grave
that i would love you to the end of time
that i would love you to the end of time
i swore that i would love you to the end of time!
so now i'm praying for the end of time
to hurry up and arrive
'cause if i gotta spend another minute with you
i don't think that i can really survive
i'll never break my promise or forget my vow
but god only knows what i can do right now
i'm praying for the end of time
it's all that i can do
praying for the end of time, so i can end my life with you!!

it was long ago and it was far away
and it was so much better that it is today

it never felt so good
it never felt so right
and we were glowing like
a metal on the edge of a knife
