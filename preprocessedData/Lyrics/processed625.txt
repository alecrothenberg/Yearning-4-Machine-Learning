you'd think that people would have had enough of silly love songs.
but i look around me and i see it isn't so.
some people wanna fill the world with silly love songs.
and what's wrong with that?
i'd like to know, 'cause here i go again
i love you, i love you,
i love you, i love you.

i can't explain the feeling's plain to me; 
say can't you see?
ah, she gave me more, she gave it all to me
now can't you see, what's wrong with that
i need to know, 'cause here i go again
i love you, i love you,
i love you, i love you.

love doesn't come in a minute,
sometimes it doesn't come at all
i only know that when i'm in it
it isn't silly, no, it isn't silly, 
love isn't silly at all.

how can i tell you about my loved one?
how can i tell you about my loved one?
how can i tell you about my loved one?
(i love you)
how can i tell you about my loved one?
(i love you)
