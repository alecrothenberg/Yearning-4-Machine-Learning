making time
shooting lines
for people to believe in
things you say
gone in a day
everybody leavin'
everybody leavin'

why do we have to carry on?
always singing the same old song
same old song
the same old song

tellin' lies
closing your eyes
making more excuses
pullin' the wool
actin' the fool
people have their uses
people have their uses

why do we have to carry on?
always singing the same old song
same old song
the same old song

lookin' for
an open door
never taking chances 
take your pick
makes you sick
seekin' new advances
seekin' new advances

why do we have to carry on?
always singing the same old song
