don't you worry 'bout what's on your mind (oh my)
i'm in no hurry i can take my time (oh my)
i'm going red and my tongue's getting tied (tongues' getting tied)
i'm off my head and my mouth's getting dry.
i'm high, but i try, try, try (oh my)
let's spend the night together
now i need you more than ever
let's spend the night together now

i feel so strong that i can't disguise (oh my)
let's spend the night together
but i just can't apologize (oh no)
let's spend the night together
don't hang me up and don't let me down (don't let me down)
we could have fun just groovin' around around and around
oh my, my
let's spend the night together
now i need you more than ever
let's spend the night together

let's spend the night together
now i need you more than ever
