i don't care how long this lasts
we have no future - we have no past
i write this now while i'm in control
i'll choose the words and how the melody goes -

along winding streets, we walked hand in hand
and how i long for that sharp wind
to take my breath away again
i'd run my fingers through your hair
hair like a wheat field, i'd run through
that i'd run through 

and i miss you so i miss you so
no you're gone, i feel so alone
i miss you so

i'd send you a flower a sunflower bright
while you cloud my days, messing up my nights

and all the way up to the top of your head
sunshower kisses, i felt we had

and i miss you so i miss you so
all i gotta do, is think of you and i miss you so

baby i'm afraid to say why i miss you so
 i don't care how long this lasts
we have no future - we have no past
i write this now while i'm in control
i'll choose the words and how the melody goes -

along winding streets, we walked hand in hand
and how i long for that sharp wind
to take my breath away again
i'd run my fingers through your hair
hair like a wheat field, i'd run through
that i'd run through 

and i miss you so i miss you so
no you're gone, i feel so alone
i miss you so

i'd send you a flower a sunflower bright
while you cloud my days, messing up my nights

and all the way up to the top of your head
sunshower kisses, i felt we had

and i miss you so i miss you so
all i gotta do, is think of you and i miss you so

baby i'm afraid to say why i miss you so
 i don't care how long this lasts
we have no future - we have no past
i write this now while i'm in control
