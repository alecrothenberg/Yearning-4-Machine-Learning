when i was seven
i asked my mother
to trip me to the bay
and put me on a ship
and lower me down
lower me out of here

because when i was seven
i wanted to live in a bathysphere

between coral
silent eel
silver swordfish
i can't really feel or dream down here

and if the water should cut my line (*2)
set me free
and if the water should cut my line
set me free, i don't mind
i'll be the lost sailor, my home is the sea

when i was seven
my father said to me
'but you can't swim'
and i've never dreamed of the sea again
 when i was seven
i asked my mother
to trip me to the bay
and put me on a ship
and lower me down
lower me out of here

because when i was seven
i wanted to live in a bathysphere

between coral
silent eel
silver swordfish
i can't really feel or dream down here

and if the water should cut my line (*2)
set me free
and if the water should cut my line
set me free, i don't mind
i'll be the lost sailor, my home is the sea
