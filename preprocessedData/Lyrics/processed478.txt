outside another yellow moon 
has punched a hole in the nighttime, yes
i climb through the window and down to the street
i'm shining like a new dime
the downtown trains are full with all of those brooklyn girls
they try so hard to break out of their little worlds

well you wave your hand and they scatter like crows
they have nothing that will ever capture your heart
they're just thorns without the rose
be careful of them in the dark
oh, if i was the one you chose to be your only one
oh baby can't you hear me now, can't you hear me now

will i see you tonight on a downtown train
every night it's just the same, you leave me lonely now

i know your window and i know it's late
i know your stairs and your doorway
i walk down your street and past your gate
i stand by the light at the four-way
you watch them as they fall, oh baby, they all have heart attacks
they stay at the carnival, but they'll never win you back

will i see you tonight on a downtown train
where every night, every night it's just the same, oh baby 
will i see you tonight on a downtown train
all of my dreams they fall like rain, oh baby on a downtown train

will i see you tonight on a downtown train
where every night, every night it's just the same, oh baby 
will i see you tonight on a downtown train
all of my dreams just fall like rain, all on a downtown train
all on a downtown train, all on a downtown train
all on a downtown train, a downtown train
 outside another yellow moon 
has punched a hole in the nighttime, yes
i climb through the window and down to the street
i'm shining like a new dime
the downtown trains are full with all of those brooklyn girls
