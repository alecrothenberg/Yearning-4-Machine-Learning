come sail your ships around me
and burn your bridges down
we make a little history, baby
every time you come around 

come loose your dogs upon me
and let your hair hang down
you are a little mystery to me
every time you come around 

we talk about it all night long
we define our moral ground
but when i crawl into your arms
everything comes tumbling down 

come sail your ships around me
and burn your bridges down
we make a little history, baby
every time you come around 

your face has fallen sad now
for you know the time is nigh
when i must remove your wings
and you, you must try to fly 

come sail your ships around me
and burn your bridges down
we make a little history, baby
every time you come around 

come loose your dogs upon me
and let your hair hang down
you are a little mystery to me
every time you come around
 come sail your ships around me
and burn your bridges down
we make a little history, baby
every time you come around 

come loose your dogs upon me
and let your hair hang down
you are a little mystery to me
every time you come around 

we talk about it all night long
we define our moral ground
but when i crawl into your arms
everything comes tumbling down 

come sail your ships around me
and burn your bridges down
we make a little history, baby
every time you come around 

your face has fallen sad now
for you know the time is nigh
when i must remove your wings
and you, you must try to fly 

come sail your ships around me
and burn your bridges down
we make a little history, baby
every time you come around 

come loose your dogs upon me
and let your hair hang down
you are a little mystery to me
every time you come around
 come sail your ships around me
and burn your bridges down
we make a little history, baby
every time you come around 

come loose your dogs upon me
