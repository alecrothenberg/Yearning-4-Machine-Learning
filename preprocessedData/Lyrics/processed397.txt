i keep on fallin'... in--- love with you
sometimes i love ya, sometimes you make me blue
sometimes i feel good, at times i feel used
lovin' you darlin', makes me so confused

i never loved someone the way that i'm lovin' you

how do you give me so much pleasure,
cause me so much pain,
'cause when i
think i'm taking
more than would a fool i start
fallin' back in love with you.
