i never had it
i never wanted it
i never had your beauty mark
nor did i have your black hair
and hazel eyes
my early childhood was not as simple
as yours set in the country
no i did not have a fear of nuns who dressed in black
but i do have your taste
i had no radio show
nor did i have home-made clothes
home-made curtains of the same material

i never had it
i never wanted it
i never had your beauty mark

but i do have your taste
and i do have your round face and long hands
i think callas sang a lovely "norma"
you prefer robeson in "deep river"
i may not be so manly
but still i know you love me
even if i don't have your beauty mark
 i never had it
