rip them down
hold me up
tell them that
i'm your gun
pull my trigger
i am bigger than-

mr. prez in his big white house
listen he says we're comin' out
infiltration-we're numbin' your minds
concentration-we've done time

[repeat chorus]

over there the queen she says
let's stamp them out and dry
those tears

saturation-we want in taxes
flagelation-we've got gashes

[repeat chorus]

in the cold, the czars claimin'
just protectin', rockets aimin'
alteration-earth is changin'
observation-we want action

[repeat chorus]

i the emperor proclaim
us the masters we rule the game
inclination-somethin' to dream on
deprivation-we are sons

[repeat chorus]
 rip them down
hold me up
tell them that
i'm your gun
pull my trigger
i am bigger than-

mr. prez in his big white house
listen he says we're comin' out
infiltration-we're numbin' your minds
concentration-we've done time
