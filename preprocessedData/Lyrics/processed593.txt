jerry was a race car driver
and he drove so goddamn fast
he never did win no checkered flag
but he never did come in last
jerry was a race car driver
he'd say el solo number one
with a bocephus sticker
on his 442 he'd light 'em up
just for fun

captain pierce was a fireman
richmond engine number three
i'll be a wealthy man when i get
a dime for all the things that
man taught to me
captain pierce was a strong man
strong as any man alive
it stuck in his craw that they
made him retire at the age of 65

jerry was a race car driver
22 years old
had too many cold beers one night
and wrapped himself around a telephone pole.
