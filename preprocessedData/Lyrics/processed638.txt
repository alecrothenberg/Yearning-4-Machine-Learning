sometimes i step into timeless zone,
and i lose my way.
i don't know where i am.
sometimes i feel like i'm in the milky way.
and i lose myself.
i don't know who i am .
i discover whiskers of a cat in a timeless zone.
and i put them on my face.
in a moment i become a sweet little cat.
and i dance on a flying saucer. 

i am a cat.
