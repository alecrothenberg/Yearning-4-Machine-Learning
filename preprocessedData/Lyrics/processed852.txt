you're it
no, you're it
hey, you're really it
you're it
no i mean it, you're it

say it
don't spray it
spirit desire (face me)
spirit desire (don't displace me)
spirit desire
we will fall

miss me
don't dismiss me

spirit desire

spirit desire [x3]
we will fall
spirit desire
we will fall
spirit desire [x3]
we will fall
spirit desire
we will fall

everybody's talking 'bout the stormy weather
and what's a man do to but work out whether it's true?
looking for a man with a focus and a temper
who can open up a map and see between one and two

time to get it
before you let it
get to you

here he comes now
stick to your guns
and let him through

everybody's coming from the winter vacation
taking in the sun in a exaltation to you
you come running in on platform shoes
with marshall stacks
to at least just give us a clue
ah, here it comes
i know it's someone i knew

teenage riot in a public station
gonna fight and tear it up in a hypernation for you

now i see it
i think i'll leave it out of the way
now i come near you
and it's not clear why you fade away

looking for a ride to your secret location
where the kids are setting up a free-speed nation, for you
got a foghorn and a drum and a hammer that's rockin'
and a cord and a pedal and a lock, that'll do me for now

it better work out
i hope it works out my way
'cause it's getting kind of quiet in my city's head
takes a teen age riot to get me out of bed right now

you better look it
we're gonna shake it
up to him

he acts the hero
we paint a zero
on his hand

we know it's down
we know it's bound too loose
everybody's sound is round it
everybody wants to be proud to choose
so who's to take the blame for the stormy weather
you're never gonna stop all the teenage leather and booze

it's time to go round
a one man showdown
teach us how to fail

we're off the streets now
and back on the road
on the riot trail
 you're it
no, you're it
hey, you're really it
you're it
no i mean it, you're it

say it
don't spray it
spirit desire (face me)
spirit desire (don't displace me)
