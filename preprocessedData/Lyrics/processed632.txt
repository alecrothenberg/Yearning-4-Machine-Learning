'twas the night before christmas, and all through the house,
not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
suddenly i heard a strange noise down below,
so in my flanel pyjamas, on my tippy toe,
i couldn't see anything from the spot where i stood,
so i slid down the bannister, just as fast as i could.

all i want for christmas is my two front teeth (thweeth)
my two front teeth (thweeth)
see, my two front teeth. (thweeth)
gee, if i could only have my two front teeth (thweeth)
then i could wish you merry chrissmass.

it seems so long since i could say:
sister susie sitting on a thistle
every time i try to speak all i do is whistle: ssssssss.

all i want for christmas is my two front teeth
my two front teeth (thweeth)
see, my two front teeth. (thweeth thweeth)
gee, if i could only have my two front teeth
then i could wish you merry chrissmass.

(jingle bells)

good old santa claus and all his reindeer, they used to bring me lots of toys and candy
but now when i go out and call: 'dancer, prancer, donner and blitzen', none of them can understand me

all i want for christmas is my two front teeth
my two front teeth (thweeth)
my two front teeth.(thweeth thweeth)
all i want for christmas is my two front teeth
so i can wish you merry chrissmass.

chrissmass - chrissmass - oh, for goodness sakes: happy new year!
