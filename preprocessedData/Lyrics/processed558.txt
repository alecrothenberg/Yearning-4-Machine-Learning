on a hot summer night would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses?
will he offer me his mouth?

yes

will he offer me his teeth?

yes

will he offer me his jaws?

yes

will he offer me his hunger?

yes

again, will he offer me his hunger?

yes!

and will he starve without me?

yes!

and does he love me?

yes 

yes 

on a hot summer night would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses?

yes

i bet you to say that to all the boys.

it was a hot summer night and the beach was burning
there was fog crawling over the sand
when i listened to your heart i hear the whole world turning
i see the shooting stars
falling through your trembling hands

you were licking your lips and your lipstick shining
i was dying just to ask for a taste
we were lying together in a silver lining
by the light of the moon
you know there's not another moment
not another moment
not another moment to waste

when you hold me so close that my knees grow weak
and my soul is flying high above the ground
i'm trying to speak but no matter what i do
i just can't seem to make any sound

and then you took the words right out of my mouth
oh it must have been while you were kissing me
you took the words right out of my mouth
and i swear it's true
i was just about to say i love you

and then you took the words right out of my mouth
oh it must have been while you were kissing me
you took the words right out of my mouth
and i swear it's true
i was just about to say i love you

now my body is shaking like a wave on the water
and i guess that i'm beginning to grin
oh, we're finally alone and we can do what we want to
the night is young
and ain't no one gonna know where you
no one gonna know where you
no one's gonna know where you've been

you were licking your lips and your lipstick shining
i was dying just to ask for a taste
we were lying together in a silver lining
by the light of the moon
you know there's not another moment
not another moment
not another moment to waste

and then you took the words right out of my mouth
