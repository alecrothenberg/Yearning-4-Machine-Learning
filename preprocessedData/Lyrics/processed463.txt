this old world may never change
the way it's been
and all the ways of war
can't change it back again

i've been searchin'
for the dolphins in the sea
and sometimes i wonder
do you ever think of me

i'm not the one to tell this world
how to get along
i only know the peace will come
when all hate is gone

i've been searchin'...

you know sometimes i think about
saturday's child
and all about the time
when we were running wild

i've been searchin'...

this old world may never change
this world may never change
this world may never change

can't change it back again
