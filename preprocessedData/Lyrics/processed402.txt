i go out walkin' after midnight
out in the moonlight
just like we used to do
i'm always walkin' after midnight searchin' for you

i walk for miles along the highway
well, that's just my way
of sayin' i love you
i'm always walkin' after midnight, searchin' for you

[chorus:]
i stop to see a weepin' willow
cryin' on his pillow
maybe he's cryin' for me
and as the skies turn gloomy
night winds whisper to me
i'm lonesome as i can be

i go out walkin' after midnight
out in the moonlight*
just hopin' you may be
somewhere a-walkin' after midnight, searchin' for me

[repeat chorus]

[repeat last verse ]
 i go out walkin' after midnight

i'm always walkin' after midnight, searchin' for you

night winds whisper to me

out in the moonlight*
just hopin' you may be
somewhere a-walkin' after midnight, searchin' for me
