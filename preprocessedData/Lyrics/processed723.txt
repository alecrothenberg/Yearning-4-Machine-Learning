toe to toe
dancing very slow
barely breathing
almost comatose
wall to wall
people hypnotized
and they're stepping lightly
hang each night in rapture

back to back
sacroiliac
spineless movement
and a wild attack

face to face
sadly solitude
and it's finger popping
twenty-four hour shopping in rapture

fab five freddie told me everybody's high
dj's spinnin' are savin' my mind
flash is fast, flash is cool
francois sez fas, flashe' no do
and you don't stop, sure shot
go out to the parking lot
and you get in your car and you drive real far
and you drive all night and then you see a light
and it comes right down and lands on the ground
and out comes a man from mars
and you try to run but he's got a gun
and he shoots you dead and he eats your head
and then you're in the man from mars
you go out at night, eatin' cars
you eat cadillacs, lincolns too
mercurys and subarus
and you don't stop, you keep on eatin' cars
then, when there's no more cars
you go out at night and eat up bars where the people meet
face to face, dance cheek to cheek
one to one, man to man
dance toe to toe
don't move to slow, 'cause the man from mars
is through with cars, he's eatin' bars
yeah, wall to wall, door to door, hall to hall
he's gonna eat 'em all
rapture, be pure
take a tour, through the sewer
don't strain your brain, paint a train
you'll be singin' in the rain
i said don't stop, to punk rock

well now you see what you wanna be
just have your party on tv
'cause the man from mars won't eat up bars when the tv's on
and now he's gone back up to space
where he won't have a hassle with the human race
and you hip-hop, and you don't stop
just blast off, sure shot
'cause the man from mars stopped eatin' cars and eatin' bars
and now he only eats guitars, get up!
