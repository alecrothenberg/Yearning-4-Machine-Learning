i found my thrill on blueberry hill
on blueberry hill where i found you
the moon stood still on blueberry hill
and lingered till my dreams came true

the wind in the willow played
love's sweet melody
but all of those vows we made
were never to be

tho' we're apart you're part of me still
for you were my thrill on blueberry hill

the wind in the willow played
love's sweet melody
but all of those vows we made
were never to be

tho' we're apart you're part of me still
for you were my thrill on blueberry hill
