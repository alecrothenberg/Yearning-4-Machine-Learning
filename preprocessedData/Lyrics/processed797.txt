i am governor jerry brown
my aura smiles
and never frowns
soon i will be president!

carter power will soon go away
i will be f hrer one day
i will command all of you
your kids will meditate in school [x2]

california!  ber alles!
california!  ber alles!
 ber alles! california!
 ber alles! california!

zen fascists will control you
100% natural
you will jog for the master race
and always wear the happy face
close your eyes, can't happen here
big bro' on white horse is near
the hippies won't come back you say
mellow out or you will pay [x2]

california!  ber alles!
california!  ber alles!
 ber alles! california!
 ber alles! california!

now it is 1984
knock! knock! at your front door
it's the suede/denim secret police
they have come for your uncool niece

come quietly to the camp
you'd look nice as a drawstring lamp
don't you worry, it's only a shower
for your clothes here's a pretty flower!

die on organic poison gas
serpent's egg's already hatched
you will croak, you little clown!
when you mess with president brown [x2]
