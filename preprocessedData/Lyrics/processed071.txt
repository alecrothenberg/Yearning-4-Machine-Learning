i was born by the river in a little tent 
oh and just like the river 
i've been running ever since 
it's been a long, a long time coming 
but i know a change gonna come, oh yes it will 

it's been too hard living 
but i'm afraid to die 
cause i don't know 
what's up there beyond the sky 
it's been a long, a long time coming 
but i know a change gonna come, 
oh yes it will 

i go to the movie 
and i go downtown 
somebody keep telling me 
don't hang around 
it's been a long, 
a long time coming 
but i know a change gonna come, 
oh yes it will 

then i go to my brother 
and i say brother help me please 
but he winds up knockin' me 
back down on my knees 

ohhhhhhhhh..... 

there been times that i thought i couldn't last for long 
but now i think i'm able to carry on 
it's been a long, a long time coming 
but i know a change gonna come, oh yes it will
