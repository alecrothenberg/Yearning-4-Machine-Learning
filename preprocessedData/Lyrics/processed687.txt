my babe don't buy me presents
how can you laugh when you know i'm down?
beep-beep, beep-beep, yeah!

i got something to say
that might cause you pain
if i catch you talking 
to that boy again
i'm gonna let you down (yes, yes, you're gonna lose that girl)
and leave you flat (gonna let you down and leave you flat)
because i told you before (good day sunshine)
oh, you can't do that (it's been a hard day's night)

well, it's the second time
i've caught you talking to him (i wanna hold your hand)
do i have to tell you one more time 
i think it's a sin?
i think i'll let you down (yes, yes, you're gonna lose that girl)
and leave you flat (gonna let you down and leave you flat)
because i told you before (good day sunshine)
oh, you can't do that (day tripper, yeah!)

paperback writer, yeah!

everybody's green
'cos i'm the one who stole your love
but if it's seen
me talking that way
they'd laugh in my face

so, please listen to me
if you want to stay mine (would you like to know a secret?)
i can't help my feelings
i'd go out of my mind 
i'm gonna let you down (yes, yes, i'm gonna leave you flat)
and leave you flat (gonna let you down and leave you flat)
because i told you before 
i can't believe in yesterday
