under blue moon i saw you 
so soon you'll take me 
up in your arms 
too late to beg you or cancel it 
though i know it must be the killing time 
unwillingly mine 

fate 
up against your will 
through the thick and thin 
he will wait until 
you give yourself to him 

in starlit nights i saw you 
so cruelly you kissed me 
your lips a magic world 
your sky all hung with jewels 
the killing moon 
will come too soon 

fate 
up against your will 
through the thick and thin 
he will wait until 
you give yourself to him
