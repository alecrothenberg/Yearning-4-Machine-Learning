i heard the front door closing softly              
as i awakened from my sleep                             
with the last touch of her kips, lord                   
like a whisper on my cheek                           

and i cursed the sun for risin'                         
'cause the worst, lord, was yet to come
'cause this morning, she's just leavin'
but, come sundown, she'll be gone
                                               
see the lipstick on the pillow                 
that i placed beneath her head
and the soft sheets still feel warm, lord
where she lay upon my bed

and it hurts to know it's over
for the hurt, lord, has just begun     
'cause this morning, she's just leavin'
but, come sundown, she'll be gone
