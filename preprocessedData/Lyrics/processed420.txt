at my door the leaves are falling
a cold wild wind has come
sweethearts walk by together
and i still miss someone

i go out on a party
and look for a little fun
but i find a darkened corner
because i still miss someone

oh, no i never got over those blues eyes
i see them every where
i miss those arms that held me
when all the love was there

i wonder if she's sorry
for leavin' what we'd begun
there's someone for me somewhere
and i still miss someone
 at my door the leaves are falling
a cold wild wind has come
sweethearts walk by together
and i still miss someone

i go out on a party
and look for a little fun
but i find a darkened corner
because i still miss someone

oh, no i never got over those blues eyes
i see them every where
i miss those arms that held me
when all the love was there

i wonder if she's sorry
for leavin' what we'd begun
there's someone for me somewhere
and i still miss someone
 at my door the leaves are falling
a cold wild wind has come
sweethearts walk by together
and i still miss someone

i go out on a party
and look for a little fun
but i find a darkened corner
because i still miss someone

oh, no i never got over those blues eyes
i see them every where
i miss those arms that held me
when all the love was there

i wonder if she's sorry
for leavin' what we'd begun
there's someone for me somewhere
and i still miss someone
 at my door the leaves are falling
a cold wild wind has come
sweethearts walk by together
and i still miss someone

i go out on a party
and look for a little fun
but i find a darkened corner
because i still miss someone

oh, no i never got over those blues eyes
i see them every where
i miss those arms that held me
when all the love was there

i wonder if she's sorry
