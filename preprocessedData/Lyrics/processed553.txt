it's poetry in motion
she turned her tender eyes to me
as deep as any ocean
as sweet as any harmony
mm, but she blinded me with science
"she blinded me with science!"
and failed me in biology
when i'm dancing close to her
"blinding me with science, science!"
i can smell the chemicals
"blinding me with science, science!"
"science!"
"science!"
mm, but it's poetry in motion
and when she turned her eyes to me
as deep as any ocean
as sweet as any harmony
mm, but she blinded me with science
and failed me in geometry
when she's dancing next to me
"blinding me with science, science!"
"science!"
i can hear machinery
"blinding me with science, science!"
"science!"
it's poetry in motion
and now she's making love to me
the spheres're in commotion
the elements in harmony
she blinded me with science
"she blinded me with science!"
and hit me with technology
"good heavens miss sakamoto, you're beautiful!"
i 
i don't believe it!
there she goes again!
she's tidied up, and i can't find anything!
all my tubes and wires
and careful notes
and antiquated notions
but! it's poetry in motion
and when she turned her eyes to me
as deep as any ocean
as sweet as any harmony
mm, but she blinded me with science
"she blinded me with, with science!"
she blinded me with
