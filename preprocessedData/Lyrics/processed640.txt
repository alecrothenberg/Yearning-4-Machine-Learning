judy wrote the saddest song
she showed it to a boy in school today
judy, where did you go wrong?
you used to make me smile when i was down
judy was a teenage rebel
she did it with a boy when she was young
she gave herself to books and learning
she gave herself to being number one
judy, i don't know you if you're gonna show me everything
judy, i don't know you if you're gonna show me everything

judy got a book at school
she went under the covers with her torch
she fell asleep till it was morning
she dreamt about the girl who stole a horse
judy never felt so good except when she was sleeping
judy never felt so good except when she was sleeping

judy, let's go for a walk
we can kiss and do whatever you want
but you will be disappointed
you will fall asleep with ants in your pants
judy, you're just trying to find and keep the dream of horses
and the song she wrote was judy and the dream of horses
dream of horses
you dream of horses

the best looking boys are taken
the best looking girls are staying inside
so judy, where does that leave you?
walking the street from morning to night
with a star upon your shoulder lighting up the path that you walk
with a parrot on your shoulder, saying everything when you talk
if you're ever feeling blue
then write another song about your dream of horses
write a song about your dream of horses
call it judy and the dream of horses
call it judy and the dream of horses
you dream of horses
