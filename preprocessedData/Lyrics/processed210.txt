difficult preaching is posdnuos' pleasure 
pleasure and preaching starts in the heart 
something that stimulates the music in my measure 
measure in my music, raised in three parts 
casually see but don't do like the soul 
'cause seein' and doin' are actions for monkeys 
doin' hip hop hustle, no rock and roll 
unless your name's brewster, 'cause brewster's a punky 
parents let go 'cause there's magic in the air 
criticising rap shows you're out of order 
stop look and listen to the phrasin' fred astaires 
and don't get offended while mase do-se-do's your daughter 
a tri-camera rolls since our music's now set 
fly rhymes are stored on a d.a.i.s.y. production 
it stands for &quot;da inner sound y'all&quot; and y'all can bet 
that the action's not a trick, but showing the function 

everybody wants to be a deejay 
everybody wants to be an emcee 
but being speakers are the best 
and you don't have to guess 
de la soul posse consists of three 
and that's the magic number 

dove: 
this here piece of the pie 
is not dessert but the course that we dine 
and three out of every darn time 
the effect is &quot;mmmm&quot; when a daisy grows in your mind 
showing true position, this here piece is 
kissin' the part of the pie that's missin' 
when that negative number fills up the casualty 
maybe you can subtract it 
you can call it your lucky partner 
maybe you can call it your adjective 
but odd as it may be 
without my 1 and 2 where would there be 
my 3 
mase pos and me 
and that's the magic number 

focus is formed by flaunts to the soul 
souls who flaunt styles gain praises by pounds 
common are speakers who are never scrolls 
scrolls written daily creates a new sound 
listeners listen 'cause this here is wisdom 
wisdom of a speaker, a dove and a plug 
set aside a legal substance to feed 'em 
for now get 'em high off this dialect drug 
time is a factor so it's time to count 
count not the negative actions of one 
speakers of soul say it's time to shout 
three forms the soul to a positive sum 
dance to this fix and flex every muscle 
space can be filled if you rise like my lumber 
advance to the tune but don't do the hustle 
shake, rattle, roll to my magic number 

now you may try to subtract it 
but it just won't go away
