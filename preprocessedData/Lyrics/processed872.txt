you've been away for so long 
you can't ask why 
you've been away 
you can't ask why 
you can't ask why 

a million stars out tonight 
could spark neon from candlelight 
one million stars 
could spark neon from candlelight 
could spark neon from candlelight 

i'm goin' down, down to the market place 
goin' to learn to give 
i'm goin' down, down by the sea market side 
goin' to learn to live 

the tightropes wound around 
just one slip and you tumble down 
the ropes wrapped around 
just one slip and you tumble down 
one slip and you tumble down

i'm goin' down, down to the market place 
goin' to learn to give 
i'm goin' down, down by the sea market side 
goin' to learn to live
 you've been away for so long 
you can't ask why 
you've been away 
you can't ask why 
you can't ask why 

a million stars out tonight 
could spark neon from candlelight 
one million stars 
could spark neon from candlelight 
could spark neon from candlelight 

i'm goin' down, down to the market place 
goin' to learn to give 
i'm goin' down, down by the sea market side 
goin' to learn to live 

the tightropes wound around 
just one slip and you tumble down 
the ropes wrapped around 
just one slip and you tumble down 
one slip and you tumble down

i'm goin' down, down to the market place 
goin' to learn to give 
i'm goin' down, down by the sea market side 
goin' to learn to live
 you've been away for so long
