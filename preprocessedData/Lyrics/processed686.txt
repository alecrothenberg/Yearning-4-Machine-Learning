joe is awful strong, bet your life he's putting us on
oh lordy, oh lordy, you know i need some loving
oh move me, touch me

she turns me on, but i'm only dancing
she turns me on, don't get me wrong
i'm only dancing

oh shadow love was quick and clean, life's a well-thumbed machine
i saw you watching from the stairs, you're everyone that ever cared
oh lordy, oh lordy, you know i need some loving
move me, touch me

[chorusx2]
