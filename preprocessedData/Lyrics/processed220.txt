in my imagination
there is no complication
i dream about you all the time
in my mind, a celebration
the sweetest of sensation
thinking you could be mine
in my imagination
there is no hesitation
we walk together hand in hand

i'm dreaming
you fell in love with me
like i'm in love with you
but dreaming's all i do
if only they'd come true

[chorus]
i should be so lucky
lucky, lucky, lucky
i should be so lucky in love
i should be so lucky
lucky, lucky, lucky
i should be so lucky in love

it's a crazy situation
you always keep me waiting
because it's only make believe
and i would come a-running
to give you all my loving
if one day you would notice me
my heart is close to breaking
and i can't go on faking
the fantasy that you'll be mine

i'm dreaming
that you're in love with me
like i'm in love with you
but dreaming's all i do
if only they'd come true

[chorus]

i should be so lucky (so lucky, so lucky)
i should be so lucky
i,i (i,i)
