he falls down drunk, i hold him up
he drinks and i refill his cup
then i take him home and put him to bed
 he wakes me in the dead of night
lets me be his second sight
to guide him when he's sleep-walking
listen when he's sweet-talking
 i see the end of the road in his eyes
he's got a long way to go

 i hold him like a loaded gun
i know he might go off with anyone
but i know he's only tryin' to have some fun
 he sees a couple of things in me
like how i'm not very hard to please
it's really pretty easy
i see my long lost home in his eyes
he sees a nice hotel in mine

 i'll stick it out forever babe
if we keep coming back together maybe
you'll start to see it like me

 i'll stick it out forever babe
if we keep coming back together maybe
you'll start to see it like me

 i'll stick it out forever baby x12
