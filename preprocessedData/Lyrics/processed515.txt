when the rain came i thought you'd leave
'cause i knew how much you loved the sun
but you chose to stay, stay and keep me warm
through the darkest nights i've ever known
if the mandolin wind couldn't change a thing
then i know i love ya

oh the snow fell without a break
buffalo died in the frozen fields you know
through the coldest winter in almost fourteen years
i couldn't believe you kept a smile
now i can rest assured knowing that we've seen the worst
and i know i love ya

oh i never was good with romantic words
so the next few lines come really hard
don't have much but what i've got is yours
except of course my steel guitar
ha, 'cause i know you don't play
but i'll teach you one day
because i love ya

i recall the night we knelt and prayed
noticing your face was thin and pale
i found it hard to hide my tears
i felt ashamed i felt i'd let you down
no mandolin wind couldn't change a thing
couldn't change a thing no, no

the coldest winter in almost fourteen years
could never, never change your mind

and i love ya
yes indeed and i love ya
and i love ya
lordy i love ya
