every time i think of you
i feel shot right through with a bolt of blue
it's no problem of mine but it's a problem i find
living a life that i can't leave behind
there's no sense in telling me
the wisdom of a fool won't set you free
but that's the way that it goes
and it's what nobody knows
while every day my confusion grows

chorus:
every time i see you falling
i get down on my knees and pray
i'm waiting for that final moment
you'll say the words that i can't say

i feel fine and i feel good
i feeling like i never should
whenever i get this way, i just don't know what to say
why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday?
i'm not sure what this could mean
i don't think you're what you seem
i do admit to myself
that if i hurt someone else
then i'll never see just what we're meant to be

every time i see you falling
i get down on my knees and pray
i'm waiting for that final moment
you'll say the words that i can't sayevery time i think of you
i feel shot right through with a bolt of blue
it's no problem of mine but it's a problem i find
living a life that i can't leave behind
