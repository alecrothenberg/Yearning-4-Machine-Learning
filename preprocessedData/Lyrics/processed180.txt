i wonder how you're feeling there's ringing in my ears.
and no one to relate to 'cept the sea.
who can i believe in ?  
i'm  kneeling on the floor.
there has to be a force.  who do i phone ?
the stars are out and shining.  but all i really want to know

[chorus:]
oh won't you show me the way
i want you show me the way

well, i can see no reason, you living on your nerves
when someone drop a cup and i submerge
i'm swimming in a circle, i feel i'm going down
there has to be a fool to play my part
someone thought of healing, but all i really want to know

i wonder if i'm dreaming  i feel so unashamed
i can't believe this is happening to me.
i watch you when you're sleeping
and then i want to take your love

oh won't you show me the way
i want you day after day
 i wonder how you're feeling there's ringing in my ears.
and no one to relate to 'cept the sea.
who can i believe in ?  
i'm  kneeling on the floor.
there has to be a force.  who do i phone ?
the stars are out and shining.  but all i really want to know

[chorus:]
oh won't you show me the way
i want you show me the way

well, i can see no reason, you living on your nerves
when someone drop a cup and i submerge
i'm swimming in a circle, i feel i'm going down
there has to be a fool to play my part
someone thought of healing, but all i really want to know

i wonder if i'm dreaming  i feel so unashamed
i can't believe this is happening to me.
i watch you when you're sleeping
and then i want to take your love

oh won't you show me the way
i want you day after day
