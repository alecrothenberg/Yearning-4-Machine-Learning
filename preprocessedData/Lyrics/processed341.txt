to everything - turn, turn, turn
there is a season - turn, turn, turn
and a time to every purpose under heaven 

a time to be born, a time to die
a time to plant, a time to reap
a time to kill, a time to heal
a time to laugh, a time to weep

to everything - turn, turn, turn
there is a season - turn, turn, turn
and a time to every purpose under heaven

a time to build up, a time to break down
a time to dance, a time to mourn
a time to cast away stones
a time to gather stones together

to everything - turn, turn, turn
there is a season - turn, turn, turn
and a time to every purpose under heaven

a time of love, a time of hate
a time of war, a time of peace
a time you may embrace
a time to refrain from embracing 

to everything - turn, turn, turn
there is a season - turn, turn, turn
and a time to every purpose under heaven

a time to gain, a time to lose
a time to rend, a time to sew
a time for love, a time for hate
a time for peace, i swear it's not too late!
