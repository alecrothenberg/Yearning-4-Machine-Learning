he thinks of all the lips that he licks
and all the girls that he's going to fix
she gave a little flirt, gave herself a little cuddle
but there's no place here for the mini-skirt waddle
capital punishment, she's last year's model
they call her natasha when she looks like elsie
i don't want to go to chelsea

oh no it does not move me
even though i've seen the movie
i don't want to check your pulse
i don't want nobody else
i don't want to go to chelsea

everybody's got new orders
be a nice girl and kiss the warders
now the teacher is away
all the kids begin to play

men come screaming, dressed in white coats
shake you very gently by the throat
one's named gus, one's named alfie
i don't want to go to chelsea

oh no it does not move me
even though i've seen the movie
i don't want to check your pulse
i don't want nobody else
i don't want to go to chelsea
