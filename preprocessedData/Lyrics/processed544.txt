people i know places i go
make me feel tongue tied
i can see how people look down
they're on the inside

here's where the story ends

people i see, weary of me
showing my good side
i can see how people look down
i'm on the outside

here's where the story ends
ooh here's where the story ends

it's that little souvenir of a terrible year
which makes my eyes feel sore
oh i never should have said the books that you read
were all i loved you for
it's that little souvenir of a terrible year
which makes me wonder why
& it's the memories of the shed that make me turn red
surprise surprise surprise

crazy i know, places i go
make me feel so tired
i can see how people look down
i'm on the outside

oh here's where the story ends
ooh here's where the story ends

it's that little souvenir of a terrible year
which makes my eyes feel sore
& who ever would've thought the books that you brought
were all i loved you
for
oh the devil in me said go down to the shed
i know where i belong
but the only thing i ever really wanted to say
was wrong, was wrong, was wrong

it's that little souvenir of a colorful year
which makes me smile inside
so i cynically, cynically say the world is that way
surprise, surprise, surprise, surprise, surprise

here's where the story ends
ooh here's where the story ends
 people i know places i go
make me feel tongue tied
i can see how people look down
they're on the inside
