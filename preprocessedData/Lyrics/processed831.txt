maybe again he will be alone
guess we're equally damaged
find your name do it all the same equally
signal when you can't breathe no more

say you were me then you could see the view
you'll know we are equally damaged
don't be a fool, make it easier
you'll learn to say when
signal if you can't say, "no more"

don't cross your finger
sundays will never change
they keep on coming
you'll be a freak
and i'll keep you company
 maybe again he will be alone

signal when you can't breathe no more
