how many special people change? 
how many lives are living strange? 
where were you while we were getting high? 
slowly walking down the hall 

faster than a cannonball 
where were you while we were getting high? 
someday you will find me 
caught beneath the landslide 

in a champagne supernova in the sky 
someday you will find me 
caught beneath the landslide 
in a champagne supernova 

a champagne supernova in the sky 
wake up the dawn and ask her why 
a dreamer dreams, she never dies 
wipe that tear away now from your eye 

slowly walking down the hall 
faster than a cannonball 
where were you while we were getting high? 
someday you will find me 

caught beneath the landslide 
in a champagne supernova in the sky 
someday you will find me 
caught beneath the landslide 

in a champagne supernova 
a champagne supernova 
'cause we don't believe 
that they're gonna get away from the summer 

but you and i will never die 
the world's still spinning around we don't know why 
why-why-why-why-i-i
