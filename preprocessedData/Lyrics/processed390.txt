you walked into my house last night
i couldn't help but notice
a light that was long gone
still burning strong
you were sitting
your fingers like fuses
your eyes were cinnamon

you said you'd stand for every known abuse
that was ever
threatened
to anyone but you
and why should i know better by now
when i'm old enough not to?

while every line speaks the language of love
it never held the meaning i was thinking of
and i can't decide over right or wrong
i guess sometimes you need the place where you belong

some may sing the wrong words to the wrong melody
it's little things like this that matter to me
others feel that you should stand
for every known abuse to hand
and all the things that they could never see

you said you stood for every known abuse
that was ever
promised
to anyone like you
don't you wish you knew better by now
when you're old enough not to?

when every line speaks the language of love
it never held the meaning i was thinking of
and i can't decide over right or wrong
you left the feeling that i just do not belong

(do not belong, do not belong, do not belong)

one drink too many and a joke gone too far
i see a face drive like a stolen car
gets harder to hide when you're hitching a ride
harder to hide what you really saw

oh yeah, you stand for every known abuse
that i've ever seen my way through
don't i wish i knew better by now?
well i think i'm starting to

when every line speaks the language of love
it never held the meaning i was thinking of
and i lost the line between right or wrong
i just want to find the place where i belong

(why should you know better by now
when you're old enough not to?
i wish i knew better by now
