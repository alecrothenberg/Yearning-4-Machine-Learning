twenty-five cents, hah, no, no
i wouldn't pay twenty-five cents to go in nowhere
'cause listen here.....

up in harlem ev'ry saturday night
when the highbrows get together its just too tight
they all congregates at an all night strut
and what they do is tut-tut-tut

old hannah brown from 'cross town
gets full of corn and starts breakin' 'em down
just at the break of day
you can hear old hannah say

gimme a pigfoot and a bottle of beer
send me 'gain, i don't care
i feel just like i wanna clown
give the piano player a drink
because he's bringin' me down!
he's gotta rhythm, y-e-e-a-a-h!
when he stomps his feet
he sends me right off to sleep
check all your razors and your guns
we gonna be 'rested when the wagon comes
i wanna pigfoot and a bottle of beer
send me 'cause i don't care
play me 'cause i don't care

when he stomps his feet
he sends me right off to sleep
check all your razors and your guns
do the shim-sham-shimmy 'til the risin' sun
give me a reefer and a gang o' gin
play me 'cause i'm in my sin
play me 'cause i'm full of gin
