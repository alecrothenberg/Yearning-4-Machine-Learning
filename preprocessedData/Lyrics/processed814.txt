i got you, that's all i want
i won't forget, that's a whole lot
i don't go out, not now that you're in
sometimes we shout, but that's no problem

i don't know why sometimes i get frightened
you can see my eyes, you can tell that i'm not lyin'

look at you, you're a pageant
you're everything, that i've imagined
something's wrong, i feel uneasy
you show me, tell me you're not teasin'

i don't know why sometimes i get frightened
you can see my eyes, you can tell that i'm not lyin'
i don't know why sometimes i get frightened
you can see my eyes, you can tell that i'm not lyin'

there's no doubt, not when i'm with you
when i'm without, i stay in my room
where do you go, i get no answer
you're always out, it gets on my nerves

i don't know why sometimes i get frightened
you can see my eyes, you can tell that i'm not lyin'
but i don't know why sometimes i get frightened
you can see my eyes, you can tell that i'm not lyin'
