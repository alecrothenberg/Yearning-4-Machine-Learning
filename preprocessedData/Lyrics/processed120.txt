i'm breakin' rocks in the hot sun
i fought the law and the law won
i fought the law and the law won

i needed money 'cause i had none
i fought the law and the law won
i fought the law and the law won

i left my baby and i feel so bad
i guess my race is run
but she's the best girl i've ever had
i fought the law and the law won
i fought the law and the law won

robbin' people with a six-gun
i fought the law and the law won
i fought the law and the law won

i miss my baby and the good fun
i fought the law and the law won
i fought the law and the law won

i left my baby and i feel so bad
i guess my race is run
but she's the best girl i've ever had
i fought the law and the law won
i fought the law and the law won
 i'm breakin' rocks in the hot sun
i fought the law and the law won
i fought the law and the law won

i needed money 'cause i had none
i fought the law and the law won
i fought the law and the law won

i left my baby and i feel so bad
i guess my race is run
but she's the best girl i've ever had
i fought the law and the law won
i fought the law and the law won

robbin' people with a six-gun
i fought the law and the law won
i fought the law and the law won

i miss my baby and the good fun
i fought the law and the law won
i fought the law and the law won

i left my baby and i feel so bad
i guess my race is run
but she's the best girl i've ever had
i fought the law and the law won
i fought the law and the law won
 i'm breakin' rocks in the hot sun
i fought the law and the law won
i fought the law and the law won

i needed money 'cause i had none
i fought the law and the law won
i fought the law and the law won

i left my baby and i feel so bad
