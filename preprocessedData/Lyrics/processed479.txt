the phone don't ring
and the sun refused to shine
never thought i'd have to pay so dearly
for what was already mine
for such a long, long time

we made mad love
shadow love
random love
and abandoned love
accidentally like a martyr
the hurt gets worse and the heart gets harder

the days slide by
should have done, should have done, we all sigh
never thought i'd ever be so lonely
after such a long, long time
time out of mind

we made mad love
shadow love
random love
and abandoned love
accidentally like a martyr
the hurt gets worse and the heart gets harder
 
the phone don't ring
and the sun refused to shine
never thought i'd have to pay so dearly
for what was already mine
for such a long, long time

we made mad love
shadow love
random love
and abandoned love
accidentally like a martyr
the hurt gets worse and the heart gets harder

the days slide by
should have done, should have done, we all sigh
never thought i'd ever be so lonely
after such a long, long time
