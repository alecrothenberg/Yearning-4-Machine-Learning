some folks like to get away, 
take a holiday from the neighborhood. 
hop a flight to miami beach or to hollywood. 
but i'm takin' a greyhound on the hudson river line. 
i'm in a new york state of mind.

i've seen all the movie stars in their fancy cars and their limousines. 
been high in the rockys under the evergreens. 
i know what i'm needin', and i don't want to waste more time. 
i'm in a new york state of mind.

it was so easy livin' day by day
out of touch with the rhythym and blues
but now i need a little give and take
the new york times, the daily news.

it comes down to reality, and it's fine with me cause i've let it slide. 
i don't care if it's chinatown or on riverside. 
i don't have any reasons. 
i left them all behind. 
i'm in a new york state of mind.
oh yeah.

it was so easy living day by day
out of touch with the rhythym and blues
