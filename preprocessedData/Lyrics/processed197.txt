you put the boom boom into my heart,
you send my soul sky high when your lovin' starts.
jitterbug into my brain,
goes bang bang bang till my feet do the same.

but something's bugging me
something ain't right
my best friend told me
where you were last night.

left me sleeping
in my bed.
i was dreaming
but i should've been with you instead.

chorus
wake me up before you go go,
don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo.
wake me up before you go go,
i don't want to miss it when you hit that high
. wake me up before you go go,
'cause i'm not planning on going solo.
wake me up before you go go,
take me dancing tonite.
i want to hit that high...

you get the gray skies outta my way,
you make the sun shine brighter than doris day.
turn a mere spark into a flame,
my beats per minute never been the same.

'cause you're my lady,
i'm your fool.
makes me crazy
when you act so cruel.

c'mon baby,
let's not fight.
we'll go dancing
and everything will be alright.

repeat chorus

cuddle up baby,
move in tight.
we'll go dancing tomorrow night.

it's cold out there
but it's warm in bed.
they can dance,
we'll stay home instead.
