when you were 17 and i was 19 
we feel deep in love growin' up in queens 
we didn't know a thing about love 
we was innocent, sneakin' on the doorstep to hug 
held you tightly and promised you the world 
you gave me hickeys and said you was my girl 
when i think about it now it makes me smile 
'cause i ain't felt these butterflies in a while 
funny how you grow up and innocence fades 
we used to live for love but now we're afraid 
{of what?} 
of the darkness and bitter memories 
lovers who crushed us through infidelity 
i promised you i'll love you to the end 
always and forever, since way back when, uh 
you're like candy, 
the world's sweetest friend 
you taste better now than you did back then 


you will always be my candy 
[be my] 
one day we will start a family 
you will always be my candy girl 
[you will always be my] 
(you'll be my candy girl forever) 
you will always be my candy 
[yes, you will] 
i want your love girl understand me 
[yes, you will] 
you will always be my candy girl 
(i'm down for whatever) 


while you suck caramel apple lollypops 
rain, sleet, or snow i'm troopin' up the murdock 
we used to walk down the block, hold hands 
i would get you after school 'cause i was your man 
and, any guys that want to socialize 
just know that i'mma flip on any cat that tries 
my peeps used to say i was whipped 
all your girls said,   since you got with him you flipped   
but, uh, they couldn't feel the feelings we felt 
mirrors on the ceiling we melt 
i would look up at ya 
i remember the afternoon you surrendered 
we made love, 
your temperature was high as could be 
you said,   todd, promise you ain't lyin' to me   
and as we went our separate ways you turned back 
smiled, i remember all that 


you will always be my candy 
[be my] 
one day we will start a family 
[yes, we will] 
you will always be my candy girl 
[candy girl, you're my] 
(my candy girl forever)

taste the brown sugar, 
let your climax melt you
