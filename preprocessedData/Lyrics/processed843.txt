i get up around seven
get outta bed around nine
and i don't worry about nothin' no
cause worryin's a waste of my...time

the show usually starts around seven
we go on stage around nine
get on the bus about eleven
sippin' a drink and feelin' fine

[chorus:]

we been dancin' with
mr. brownstone
he's been knockin'
he won't leave me alone

i used ta do a little
but a little wouldn't do
so the little got more and more
i just keep tryin'
ta get a little better
said a little better than before
i used ta do a little
but a little wouldn't do
so the little got more and more
i just keep tryin'
ta get a little better
said a little better than before

[chorus]

now i get up around whenever
i used ta get up on time
but that old man
he's a real muthafucker
gonna kick him on down the line
 i get up around seven
get outta bed around nine
and i don't worry about nothin' no
cause worryin's a waste of my...time

the show usually starts around seven
we go on stage around nine
get on the bus about eleven
sippin' a drink and feelin' fine
