one by one they're turning out the lights 
i've been feedin' that ol' jukebox just to hold you tight 
i guess its for the best i just put in my last dime 
i heard you whisper "we'll meet again, another place, another time" 
chairs are stacked all over tables its closing time they say 
i could wait right here forever if they'd only let me stay 
anywhere would be much better than lonely room of mine 
throug a lonely night a waitin' for 
another place, another time 
won't that room of mine be a lonely place to be 
i've been so used to holding you close to me 
won't that old stairway be hard to climb 
to a lonely room waiting for another place, another time 
won't that old stairway be hard to climb 
to a lonely room to wait for 
another place, another time
