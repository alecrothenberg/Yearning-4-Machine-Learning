wake up, got another day to get through now 
got another man to see 
got to call him on the telephone 
got to find a piece of paper 

sit down, got another letter to write 
think i'll got to get the letter just right 
there's a ringing on the telephone 
oh no, got to write a little later 
no such day as tomorrow, only one two three go! 

time - got the time tick-tick-tickin' in my head 
time - got the time tick-tick-tickin' in my head 
time - got the time tick-tick-tickin' in my head 
tickin' in my head, tickin' in my head, tickin' in my head 

if i tell you what i'm doing today 
will you shut up and get out of my way? 
someone asked me what the time is, 
i don't know 
only know i gotta go now 

no time - trying to get a watch repaired 
no time - never got a thing to wear 
hear the ringin' of the telephone no no 
hear a ringin' in my head now 
no such thing as tomorrow, only one two three go!
