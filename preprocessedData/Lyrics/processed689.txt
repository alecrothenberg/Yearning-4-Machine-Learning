cigarettes and chocolate milk
these are just a couple of my cravings
everything it seems i like's a little bit stronger
a little bit thicker, a little bit harmful for me

if i should buy jellybeans
have to eat them all in just one sitting
everything it seems i like's a little bit sweeter
a little bit fatter, a little bit harmful for me

and then there's those other things
which for several reasons we won't mention
everything about 'em is a little bit stranger, a little bit 
harder
a little bit deadly

it isn't very smart
tends to make one part
so brokenhearted

sitting here remembering me
always been a shoe made for the city
go ahead accuse me of just singing about places
with scrappy boys faces have general run of the town

playing with prodigal sons
takes a lot of sentimental valiums
can't expect the world to be your raggedy andy
while running on empty you little old doll with a frown

you got to keep in the game
retaining mystique while facing forward
i suggest a reading of a lesson in tightropes
or surfing your high hopes or adios kansas

it isn't very smart
tends to make one part
so brokenhearted

still there's not a show on my back
holes or a friendly intervention
i'm just a little bit heiress, a little bit irish
a little bit tower of pisa
whenever i see ya
so please be kind if i'm a mess
