pos: 
greetings  girl  and welcome to my world of phrase 
i'm right up to bat 
it's a daisy age and you're about to walk top stage 
so wipe your lottos on the mat 
hip hop love this is and don't mind when i quiz your 
involvements before the sun 
but clear your court 'cause this is a one man sport 
and who's better for this than plug one 
now you don't have to worry about me squashin' other deals 
'cause they've already been squooshed 
freeze a frame about moods the same which we can continue 
right behind the bush 
you'll stay with me 
eye know this 
but not because of all my earthly treasures 
or regardless to the fact that i'm posdnuos 
but because 
(eye know eye love you better) 
dove: 
may i cut this dance to introduce myself as 
the chosen one to speak 
let me lay my hand across yours 
and aim a kiss upon your cheek 
they name's plug two 
and from the soul i bring you 
the daisy of your choice 
may it be filled with the pleasure principle 
in circumference to my voice 
about those other jennys i reckoned with 
lost them all like a homework excuse 
this time the magic number is two 
'cause it takes two, not three, to seduce 
my destiny of love is brought to an apex 
sex is a mere molecule 
in this world of love that i have for you 
it's true 
(eye know eye love you better) 
pos: 
now it's time to let this rhyme style 
get somewhat poured in the mold 
take my hand and we'll pick my plantation 
of daisies for a bouquet of soul 
life will begin at the cut of a rim 
take it as filled to the rim as in brim 
squeeze your stoop like betty boop 
we'll make campbell's alphabet soup 
and spell plug one's within 
forward march is the say 
when transistors will play 
come into bed is the mood 
dolby sound will be then top crowned 
when i put the needle into your groove 
i got a good thing 
and in full swing 
i show this in gifts, words or letters 
but even without those three 
eye know you'll be close to me 'cause 
(eye know i love you better) 
dove: 
it's i again and the song that i send 
is taking steps to reach your heart 
any moment you feel alone 
i can fill up your empty part 
we can ascend 'till we reach de la heaven 
and in a spin we'll hit the top ten 
then we will meet mr stuckie 
and pos' brother lucky will preach 
let the wedding begin 
shot by an arrow of cupid 
through the string of a g-clef 
my dear, i claim you're def 
and if you can hear me, by golly gee, 
trugoy is ready for what you possess 
we could live in my plug two home 
and on mars where we could be all alone 
and we make a song for two, 
picture perfect things and i sing of how 
(eye know i love you better)
