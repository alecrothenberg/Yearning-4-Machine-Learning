blackberry way absolutely pouring down with rain,
it's a terrible day.
up with the lark, silly girl i don't know what to say,
she was running away.
but now i'm standing on the corner,
lost in the things that i said.
what am i supposed to do now?

goodbye blackberry way
i can't see you, i don't need you.
goodbye blackberry way
sure to want me back another day.

flowers in the park overgrowing but the trees are bare
there's a memory there.
boats on the lake, unattended now for all to drown
i'm incredibly down.
just like myself they are neglected,
turn with my eyes to the wall
what am i supposed to do now?

goodbye blackberry way

i can't see you, i don't need you.
goodbye blackberry way
sure to want me back another day.

run for the train, look behind you for she may be there
said a thing in the air
blackberry way, see the battlefield of careless sins
cast to the winds
so full of emptiness without her,
lost in the words that i said.
what am i supposed to do now?
