every breath you take
every move you make
every bond you break
every step you take
i'll be watching you.

every single day
every word you say
every game you play
every night you stay
i'll be watching you.

oh can't you see
you belong to me?
how my poor heart aches with every step you take.

every move you make
every vow you break
every smile you fake
every claim you stake
i'll be watching you.

since you've gone i've been lost without a trace.
i dream at night, i can only see your face.
i look around but it's you i can't replace.
i keep crying baby, baby please..................

every move you make
every vow you break
every smile you fake
every claim you stake
i'll be watching you.
