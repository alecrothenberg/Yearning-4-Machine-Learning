(ooh white lines) vision dreams of passion 
(blowin' through my mind) and all the while i think of you 
(high price) a very strange reaction 
(for us to unwind) the more i see, the more i do
(something like a phenomenon) baby!
(tellin your body to come along, but white lines blow away) 
(blow! rock it! blow!)

ticket to ride, white line highway 
tell all your friends, they can go my way 
pay your toll, sell your soul 
pound for pound costs more than gold
the longer you stay, the more you pay 
my white lines go a long way 
either up your nose or through your vein 
with nothin to gain except killin' your brain

(freeze! rock! freeze! rock! freeze! rock! freeze! rock!)
(blow!)

(ahhh) higher, baby 
(ahhh) get higher, baby! 
(ahhh) get higher, baby! 
and don't ever come down! (freebase!)

rang dang diggedy dang di-dang 
rang dang diggedy dang di-dang 
rang dang diggedy dang di-dang 
diggedy dang di-dang diggedy dang di-dang

(pipeline) pure as the driven snow 
(connected to my mind) and now i'm havin' fun, baby! 
(high price) it's getting kinda low 
(cause it makes you feel so nice) i need some one-on-one, baby!
(don't let it blow your mind away) baby!
(and go into your little hideaway 'cause white lines blow away) 
(blow! rock it! blow!)

a million magic crystals, painted pure and white 
a multi-million dollars almost overnight 
twice as sweet as sugar, twice as bitter as salt 
and if you get hooked, baby, it's nobody else's fault, so don't do it!

(freeze! rock! freeze! rock! freeze! rock! freeze! rock!)
raah! (blow!)

(ahhh) higher, baby

and don't ever come down! (freebase!)

(turns you on) you really turn me on and on
('cause you gotta come down) my temperature is risin'
(when the thrill is gone) no, i don't want you to go

a street kid gets arrested, gonna do some time
he got out three years from now just to commit more crime
a businessman is caught with 24 kilos
he's out on bail and out of jail
and that's the way it goes
raah!

(kane! sugar! kane! sugar! kane!)

athletes rejected, governerds corrected
gangsters, thugs and smugglers are thoroughly respected
the money gets divided
the women get excited
now i'm broke and it's no joke
it's hard as hell to fight it, don't buy it!

(freeze! haha ha ha! rock! freeze! rock! freeze! rock! freeze! rock!)
