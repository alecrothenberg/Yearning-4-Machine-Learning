[chorus:]
sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
sunshine in my eyes can make me cry
sunshine on the water looks so lovely
sunshine almost always makes me high

if i had a day that i could give you
i'd give to you the day just like today
if i had a song that i could sing for you
i'd sing a song to make you feel this way

[chorus]

if i had a tale that i could tell you
i'd tell a tale sure to make you smile
if i had a wish that i could wish for you
i'd make a wish for sunshine for all the while
