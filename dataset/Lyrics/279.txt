(Ride your pony) get on your pony & ride; all right! 
(Ride your pony) get on your pony & ride; ah you're ridin' high! 
Now stay beside me 

(We're gonna ride) way out west where the grass is green 
(Ride) California, you know what I mean 
(Ride) New York City & Detroit too 
(Ride) on to New Orleans, the home of the blues

Now shoot! (bang) Shoot! (bang) Shoot! (bang)

(We're gonna ride) to St. Louis where the girls are pretty 
(Ride) Atlanta, GA, what a swingin' city 
(Ride) Got to make it, that's for sho' 
(Ride) Move on furthermo' 

(chorus) 

(Pistol yeah) now get ready 
Now shoot! (bang) Shoot! (bang) Shoot! (bang)
