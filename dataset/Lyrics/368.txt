Never think to ever look around
never see it coming at you
with your head in the clouds
Looking like a fool,
drinking like a clown,
worried you be nobody,
not so far from that now

You don't feel so overcome by happiness
you're broke
do you think you might scrape your life together just in
time to find you've got no piece of mind
when everybody wants a piece of your pretty white ass

Move around, never moving on,
waiting for the thing to happen
when it's already gone

You don't feel so overcome by happiness
you're broke
do you think you might scrape your life together just in
time to find you've got no piece of mind
when everybody wants a piece of your pretty white ass

Even if you held the sun,
in the colour of your eyes
I would never be so blind, and you,
don't feel the weight rushing out of your life
don't see the light dying out of your eyes....

You don't feel so overcome by happiness
you're broke
do you think you might scrape your life together just in
time to find you've got no piece of mind
when everybody wants a piece of your pretty white ass

I don't feel I don't feel I don't feel...
