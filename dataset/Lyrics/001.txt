Mama he treats your daughter mean 
Mama he treats your daughter mean 
Mama he treats your daughter mean 
He's the meanest man I've ever seen 

Mama he treats me badly 
Makes me love him madly 
Mama he takes my money 
Makes me call him honey 

Mama he can't be trusted 
He makes me so disgusted 
All of my friends they don't understand 
What's the matter with this man 

I tell you mama he treats your daughter mean 
Mama he treats your daughter mean 
Mama he treats your daughter mean 
He's the meanest man I've ever seen 

Mama this man is lazy 
Almost drives me crazy 
Mama he makes me squeeze him 
Still my squeezes don't please him 

Mama my heart is aching 
I believe it's breaking 
I've stood all that I can stand 
What's the matter with this man? 

I tell you Mama he treats your daughter mean 
Mama he treats your daughter mean 
Mama he treats your daughter mean 
He's the meanest man I've ever seen
