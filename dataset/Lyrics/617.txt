Can you feel it 
Nothin' can save ya 
For this is the seaon of catchin' the vpors 
And since I got time, what I'm gonna do 
Is tell ya how to spread it throughout my crew 
Wel you all know TJ Swan who sang on my records 
Made the music, "Nobody Beats the Biz" 
Well, check it 
Back in the days before this began 
He usually tried to talk to this girl name Fran 
The type of female with fly Gucci wear 
With big trunk jewelry and extensions in her hair 
When Swan tried to kick it, she always fessed 
Talkin' about "Nigger, please, you work for UPS" 
Since he wasn't no type of big drug dealer 
My man TJ Swan didn't appeal to her 
But now he trucks gold and wears fly Valley boots 
Rough leather fashions and tough silk suits 
Now she stop frontin' an' wants to speak 
And be comin' to all the shows 
Every single weekend 
To get his beeper number, she'd be beggin' please 
Dyin' for the day to get skeezed 
She caught the vapors (4X) 
I got another partner that's calm and plain 
He goes by the name of the Big Daddy Kane 
A mellow type of fellow that's laid back 
Back in the days, he was nothin' like that 
I remember when he used to fight every day 
What grown-ups would tell him he would never obey 
He wore his pants hangin' down and his sneakers untied 
And a rasta-type Kango tilted to the side 
Around his neighborhood, people treated him bad 
And said he was the worst thing his mom's ever had 
They said that he will grow up to be nothin' but a hoodlum 
Or either injail or someone would shoot him 
But now he's grown up, to their surprise 
Big Daddy got a hit record sellin' worldwide 
Now the same people that didn't like him as a child be sayin' 
Can I borrow a dollar, ooh, you're a star now 
They caught the vapors (4X) 
Now I got a cousin by the name of Von Lee 
Better known to y'all as Cutmaster Cool V 
He cuts scratch, transform with finesse 
...(cuts and scratches)...and all that mess 
Well I remember when he first started to rock 
And tried to get his job in a record shop 
He was in it to win it but the boss fronted 
Said, "Sorry Mr. Lee, but there's no help wanted" 
Now my cousin Von still tried on and on and on 
'Til the like break of dawn 
To put this j-o-be	 in effect 
But they'd look right past him and be like "next" 
Now for the year of '88 
Cool V is makin' dollars so my cousin's like straight 
He walks into the same record shop as before 
And the boss'll be like, "Von, welcome to my store" 
Offerin' him a job but naw, he don't want it 
Damn it feels goo to see people up on it 
'Cause I remember when at first they wasn't 
Now guess what they caught from my cousin 
The vapors 
They caught the vapors (4X) 
Last subject of the story is about Biz Mark 
I had to work for mine to put your body in park 
When I was a teenager, I wanted to be down 
With a lot of M.C.-deejayin' crews in town 
So in school on Nobel Street, I say "Can I be down, champ" 
They said no and treated me like a wet food stamp 
After gettin' rejected, I was very depressed 
Sat and wrote some def doo-doo rhymes at my rest 
When I used to come to parties they'd make me pay 
I'd have to beg to get on the mike and rap that day 
I was never into girls, I was just into my music 
They acted like I wanted to keep it 
Instead of tryin' to use it 
But now things switched without belief 
"Yo, Biz, do you remember me from Nober Street, chief? 
We used to be down back in the days" 
It happens all the time and never ceases to amaze 
They caught the vapors (4X)
