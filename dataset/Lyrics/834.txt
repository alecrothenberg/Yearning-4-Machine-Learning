Dressed like that you must be living in a different world 
And your mother doesn't know why you can't look like all the other girls 

They stop you in the street - they wanna know your name 
To reach you on the phone - cause they know your game 
Always running up the alley - trying to get home 
Or standing on the corner - never alone 

And I don't wanna get over you 
It doesn't matter what you do 
I just can't get over you - over you 

You say the boys with the bikes and the leathers like to beat you to hell 
And the girls where you work don't treat you too well 

You think you're such a smacker - but you ain't so bad 
Get what you want - with looks like that 
Always running up the alley - trying to get home 
Or standing on the corner - never alone
