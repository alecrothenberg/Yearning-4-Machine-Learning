My life, my life, my life, my life
In the sunshine...

Everybody loves the sunshine, sunshine
Everybody loves the sunshine, sunshine
Folk's get down in the sunshine, sunshine
Folk's get brown in the sunshine

Just bee's and thangs and flowers
Just bee's and thangs and flowers
Just bee's and thangs and flowers
Just bee's and thangs and flowers

My life, my life, my life, my life
In the sunshine...

Everybody loves the sunshine, sunshine
Everybody loves the sunshine, sunshine
Folks get down in the sunshine, sunshine
Folks get brown in the sunshine

Feel what I feel, what I feel, what I feel what I'm feelin
In the sunshine
Feel what I feel, what I feel, what I feel, what I'm feelin
In the sunshine
Do what I do what I do what I do what I'm doing
In the sunshine
Do what I do what I do what I do what I'm doing
In the sunshine

Everybody loves the sunshine
Sunshine...
