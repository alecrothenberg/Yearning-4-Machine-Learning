We used to get our kicks reading surfing magazines

Some good looking people wearing

Lee cooper jeans

They're breaking on the headland, they're breaking on the shore

And when you're living in hawaii they're breaking at your door



We used to wet our fingers on surfing magazines

Going to throw school and follow those scenes

Going to get a kombi and go from beach to beach

Be the kind of people the authorities can't reach



We used to get our kicks reading surfing magazines

Wake up in the morning and the waves are clean

Standing on the headland taking in the scene

Just like they do it ... in surfing magazines
