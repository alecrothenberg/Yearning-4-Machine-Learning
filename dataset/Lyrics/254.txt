We are young, we run green
Keep our teeth nice and clean
See our friends, see the sights
Feels alright

We wake up, we go out
Smoke a fag, put it out
See our friends, see the sights
Feel alright

[Chorus:]
Are we like you?
I can't be sure
Of the scene, as she turns
We are strange, in our worlds

But we are young, we get by
Can't go mad, ain't got time
Sleep around if we like
But we're alright

Got some cash, bought some wheels
Took it out, through some fields
Lost controls, hit a wall
But we're alright

[Chorus:]

But we are young, we run green
Keep our teeth nice and clean
See our friends, see the sights
Feels alright

[Chorus:]

But we are young, we run green
Keep our teeth nice and clean
See our friends, see the sights
Feels alright
