5 AM
Friday morning
Thursday night
Far from sleep
I'm still up and driving
Can't go home obviously
So I'll just change direction
'Cause they'll soon know where I live
And I wanna live
Got a full tank and some chips
It was me and a gun and a man on my back
And I sang 'Holy Holy' as he buttoned down his pants
You can laugh
It's kinda funny
The things you think at times like these
Like I haven't seen Barbados
So I must get out of this

Yes, I wore a slinky red thing
Does that mean I should spread
For you
Your friends
Your father
Mr. Ed
It's me and a gun and a man on my back
But I haven't seen Barbados
So I must get out of this

I know what this means
Me and Jesus a few years back
Used to hang
And he said "it's your choice, babe
Just remember
I don't think you'll be back
In 3 days time
So you choose well"
Tell me what's right
Is it my right
To be on my stomach
Of Fred's Seville
It's me and a gun and a man on my back
But I haven't seen Barbados
So I must get out of this

And do you know Carolina
Where the biscuits are soft and sweet
These things that go through your head
When there's a man on your back
And you're pushed flat on your stomach
It's not a classic Cadillac
It's me and a gun and a man on my back
And I haven't seen Barbados
So I must get out of this
I haven't seen Barbados
So I must get out of this
