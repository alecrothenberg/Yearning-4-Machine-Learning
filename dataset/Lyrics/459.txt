All those dirty words 
(Jusqu'   la fin) 
They make us look so dumb 
(En plein soleil) 
We've been drinking far too much 
(Jusqu'   la fin) 
And neither of us mean what we say 
(En plein amour) 
Well you and I 
Collapsed in love 
And it looks like we might have made it 
Yes, it looks like we've made it to the end 
What happened to us? 
Soon it will be gone forever 
Infatuated only with ourselves 
And neither of us can think straight anymore
