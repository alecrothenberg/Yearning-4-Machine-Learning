Oh what delight to be given the right
To be carefree and gay once again
No longer slinking, respectfully drinking
Like civilized ladies and men

No longer need we miss
A charming scene like this:

In some secluded rendezvous
That overlooks the avenue
With someone sharing a delightful chat
Of this and that with cocktails for two

As we enjoy a cigarette
To some exquisite chansonette
Two hands are sure to slyly meet beneath
The serviette with cocktails for two

My head may go reeling
But my heart will be obedient
With intoxicating kisses
For the principal ingredient

Most any afternoon at five
We'll be so glad we're both alive
Then maybe fortune will complete her plan
That all began with cocktails for two
