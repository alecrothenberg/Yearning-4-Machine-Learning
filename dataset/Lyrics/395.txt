Mrs. Molly Jenkins sells her wares in town 
 Saturdays in the evening when the farmhands come around 
 And she sows all their names in her gown 
 Ah, but is she happy
 no no no 
 She wants a better home and a better kind of life
 But how is she going to get the things she wants,
 the things she needs as some poor wretch of a farmer's wife
 He trades the milk for booze
 And Molly wants new shoes
 And as she snuggles down 
 With some stranger in some back of the barroom bed 
 It's much too dark to the see the stranger 
 So she thinks of shoes instead
 Old Man Horace Jenkins stays at home to tend to his schemes 
 Sends for pictures of black stockings on paper legs with paper seams and he drinks until he drowns in his dreams 
 Ah, but is he happy? 
 No, no, no 
 He wants to be reborn to lead the pious life 
 But how's he going to going shed his boozy dreams when he has to bear the cross of a wicked wife 
 She claims to visit shows 
 And he pretends that's where she goes
 And as he snuggles down to his reading in a half-filled marriage bed 
 He's so ashamed of what he's reading that he gets blind drunk instead 
 Sunday breakfast with the Jenkins 
 They break the bread and cannot speak 
 She reads the rustling of his paper
 He reads the way her new shoes squeak 
 And pray God to survive another week 
 Ah, but are they happy 
 You'd be surprised between the bed and the booze and the shoes 
 They suffer least that suffer what they choose
