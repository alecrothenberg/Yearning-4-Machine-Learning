Espionage, the words to come back to me
Sidewinder, you clepto
You do steal things
Unawares, but I don't care

You can't have me
You can't have me
You can't have me
You can't have me, not for free

Gymnast, working out on the parallel rails
Cuttin' trails, screams and wails, face go pale, never fails
You do steal things
Unawares, but I don't care

You can't have me
You can't have me
You can't have me
You can't have me, not for free

The drummer said you were not very clean
The drummer said you were not very clean
And I know what he means
And I know what he means

You can't have me
You can't have me
You can't have me
You can't have me, not for free
