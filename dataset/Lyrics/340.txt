I was waiting for the sun
Then I walked on home alone
What I didn't know
Was he was waiting for you to fall

So I never made amends
For the sake of no one else
For the simple reason
That he was waiting for you to fall

It was not lost on me
It was not lost on me
Walkin' on down the road
Looking for a friend to handout
Somethin' might ease my soul

So I kept my spirits high
Entertaining passers-by
Wrapped in my confusion
While he was waiting for you to fall

It was not lost on me
It was not lost on me
Walkin' on down the road
Looking for a friend to handout
Somethin' might ease my soul

It was not lost on me
It was not lost on me
Walkin' on down the road
Walkin' on down the road
Walkin' on down the road
Walkin' on down the road
