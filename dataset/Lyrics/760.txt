I?m an axe grinder, pile driver
Mama says that I never, never mind her
Got no brains, I'm insane
The teacher says that I'm one big pain
I'm like a laser, six string razor
I've got a mouth like an alligator
I want it louder, more power
I'm gonna rock it till it strikes the hour

[Chorus]
Bang your head
Metal health will drive you mad
Bang your head
Metal health will drive you mad

I'm frustrated and out-dated
I really wanna be over-rated
I'm a finder and I'm a keeper
I'm not a loser, and I ain't no weeper
I got the boys to make the noise
Won't ever let up, hope it annoys you
Join the pack fee the crack
Well now you're here, there's no way back!

[Chorus]

Metal health will cure your crazy
Metal health will cure your mad
Metal health is what we all need
It's like a heart attack!

Bang your head wake the dead
We're all metal mad, it?s all you have
So bang your head and raise the dead oh yeah
Metal health it drives you mad, mad, mad, mad

[Chorus]

Ah get your straight jackets on tonight oh
The bad boys are gonna set you right
Oh rock ya, rock ya, rock ya
