Whenever I see your smiling face
I have to smile myself
Because I love you, yes I do

And when you give me that pretty little pout
It turns me inside out
There's something about you, baby
I don't know

Isn't it amazing a man like me
Can feel this way
Tell me how much longer
If it grows stronger every day
Oh, how much longer

I thought I was in love a couple of times before
With the girl next door
But that was long before I met you
Now I'm sure that I won't forget you

And I thank my lucky stars
That you are who you are
And not just another lovely lady
Sent down to break my heart

Isn't it amazing a man like me
Can feel this way
Tell me how much longer
If it grows stronger every day, yeah
How much longer?

No one can tell me that I'm doing wrong today
Whenever I see you smile at me
No one can tell me that I'm doing wrong today
Whenever I see your smiling face my way

No one can tell me that I'm doing wrong today
No one can tell me that I'm doing wrong today
No no darling

Ad lib to end...
