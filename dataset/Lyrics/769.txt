Well we can't take it this week
And her friends don't want another speech
Hoping for a better day to hear what she's got to say

All about that
Personality crisis you got it while it was hot
But now frustration and heartache is what you got
(That's why they talk about personality)

But now your tryin' to be some no you got to do some
Want to be someone who cow wow wows
But you think about the times you did they took every ounce
When it sure got to be a shame when you start to scream and shout
You got to contradict all those times you were butterflyin' about

(You were butterflyin')
All about that personality crisis you got it while it was hot
But now frustration and heartache is what you got
Break

And you're a prima ballerina on a Spring afternoon
Change on into the wolfman, howlin' at the moon, hooowww

All about that personality crisis you got it while it was hot
But now frustration and heartache is what you got

Now with all the crossin' fingers that mother nature says
Your mirrors get jammed up with all your friends

That personality everything starts to blend
Personality when your mind starts to blend
Personality impression of a friend,
Of a friend, of a friend, of a friend, of a friend
Personality wonderin' how celebrities ever met
(Look and find out on television)

Personality crisis you got it while it was hot
Frustration and heartache is all you got, don't you worry
Personality crisis please don't cry
It's just a personality crisis, please don't stop

Because you walk a personality
Talk a personality
