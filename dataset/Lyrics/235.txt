(I will survive without you)

(Don't tell me that you won't love me)

If you wanna leave
I won't beg you to stay
And if you gotta go, darling
Maybe it's better that way

I'm gonna be strong
I'm gonna do fine
Don't worry about this heart of mine
(And walk out that door
See if I care
Go on and go)
But...

Chorus:
Don't turn around
'cause you're gonna see my heart breakin'
Don't turn around
I don't want you seein' me cry
Just walk away
It's tearin' me apart that you're leavin'
I'm lettin' you go
But I won't let you know
I wont let you know

I won't miss your arms around me
Holdin' me tight (holdin' me tight)
And if you ever think about me
Just know that I'll be alright
(I'll be alright)

I'm gonna be strong
I'm gonna do fine
Don't worry about this heart of mine
(I know I'll survive
I'll make it through
I'll even learn to live without you)

Chorus

I wish I could scream out loud that I love you
I wish I could say to you "don't go"
As he walks away, he feels the pain gettin' strong
People in your life, they don't know what's going on
Too proud to turn around, he's gone

Chorus
