Yeah, (can you get) what you see
But you can't have what you can't

Hey, what's come down over me
It's the way you stood, it's the way you stood

'Cause things the way they are
I guess you might go real far
So feed me with your kiss

Oh, come lie down close to me
Do what you dare, oh I don't care

I will get what I can see
I'll crawl over there, I'll crawl over there

(Spread me like a) (appeal to you)
I do what I do I do what I will do

Crave, your kiss will set you free
I'll do what I should, I'll do what I should
