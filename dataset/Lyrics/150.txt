I keep my fingernails long
So they Click when I play the piano
I keep my fingernails long
So they Click when I play the piano
I'm gonna keep 'em that way
Till the Swallows get back from Texarkana.

I keep my fingernails long
So they Click when I play the piano
I keep my fingernails long
So they Click when I play the piano
I'm gonna keep 'em that way
Till the Swallows get back from Louisiana.
Well, I used to chew 'em off
I was Nervous over you.
I missed that clickin', tickin' sound,
Honey, what I'm gonna do,
Is keep my fingernails long
So they Click when I play the piano
I keep my fingernails long
So they Click when I play the piano
I'm gonna keep 'em that way
Till the Swallows get back from Alabama.
