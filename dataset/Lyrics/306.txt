You can have this dance with me  
You can hold my hand and whisper  
In my ear sweet words, 
that I love to hear  

Don't be shy, 
just take your time  
I'd like to get to know you  
I'd like to make you mine    

I've been waiting  
Sitting here so patiently  
For you to come over  
and have this dance with me  

and my number is   
Beachwood 45789  
You can call me up and have a date  
Any old time  

Don't be shy, 
just take your time  
I'd like to get to know you  
I'd like to make you mine
