I woke up alarmed 
I didn't know where I was at first 
Just that I woke up in your arms 
And almost immediately I felt sorry 
'Cause I didn't think this would happen again 
No matter what I could do or say 
Just that I didn't think this would happen again 
With or without my best intentions 
And whatever happened to a boyfriend 
The kind of guy who tries to win you over? 
And whatever happened to a boyfriend 
The kind of guy who makes love 'cause he's in it? 

And I want a boyfriend 
I want a boyfriend 
I want all that boring old shit like letters and sodas 
Letters and sodas 

You got up out of bed 
You said you had a lot of work to do 
But I heard the rest in your head 
And almost immediately I felt sorry 
'Cause I didn't think this would happen again 
No matter what I could do or say 
Just that I didn't think this would happen again 
With or without my best intentions 

And I want a boyfriend 
I want a boyfriend 
I want all that stupid old shit like letters and sodas 

And I can feel it in my bones 
I'm gonna spend another year alone 
It's fuck and run, fuck and run 
Even when I was seventeen 
Fuck and run, fuck and run 
Even when I was twelve 

And I can feel it in my bones 
I'm gonna spend my whole life alone 
It's fuck and run, fuck and run 
Even when I was seventeen 
Fuck and run, fuck and run 
Even when I was twelve 

You almost felt bad 
You said that I should call you up 
But I knew much better than that 
And almost immediately you felt sorry 
'Cause you didn't think this would happen again 
No matter what you could do or say 
Just that you didn't think this would happen again 
Without or without your best intentions 

And whatever happened to a girlfriend 
The kind of chick who tries to win you over? 
And whatever happened to a girlfriend 
The kind of chick who makes love 'cause she's in it? 

And you want a girlfriend 
You want a girlfriend 
You want all that boring old shit like letters and sodas 
Letters and sodas 
Letters and sodas 
Letters and sodas
