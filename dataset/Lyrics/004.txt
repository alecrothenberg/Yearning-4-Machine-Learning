Back in black 
I hit the sack 
It's been too long I'm glad to be back 
Yes, I'm let loose 
From the noose 
That's kept me hanging around 
I've been looking at the sky 
and it's gettin' me high 
Forget the hearse 'cause I never die 
I got nine lives 
Cats eyes 
Cruisin' every woman, never wonderin' why 

[Chorus:]
'Cause I'm back 
Yes, I'm back 
Well, I'm back 
Yes, I'm back 
Well, I'm back, back 
Well I'm back in black 
Yes, I'm back in black 

Back in the back 
Of a Cadillac 
Number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack 
Yes, I'm in a bang 
With a gang 
They've got to catch me if they want me to hang 
Cause I'm back on the track 
And I'm beatin' the flack 
Nobody's gonna get me on another rap 
So look at me now 
I'm just makin' my play 
Don't try to push your luck, just get out of my way 

[Chorus]

Well, I'm back, Yes I'm back 
Well, I'm back, Yes I'm back 
Well, I'm back, back 
Well I'm back in black 
Yes I'm back in black 

hooo yeah 
Ohh yeah 
Yes I am 
Oooh yeah, yeah Oh yeah 
Back in now 
Well I'm back, I'm back 
Back, I'm back 
Back, I'm back 
Back, I'm back 
Back, I'm back 
Back 
Back in black 
Yes I'm back in black 
Out of the sack
