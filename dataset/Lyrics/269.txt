Old man rhythm is in my shoes 
No use t'sittin' and a'singin' the blues 
So be my guest, you got nothin' to lose 
Won't ya let me take you on a sea cruise? 

Oo-ee, oo-ee baby 
Oo-ee, oo-ee baby 
Oo-ee, oo-ee baby 
Won't ya let me take you on a sea cruise? 

Feel like jumpin' baby won't ya join me please 
I don't like beggin' but I'm on bended knee 

I got to get t'rockin get my hat off the rack 
I got to boogie woogie like a knife in the back 
So be my guest, you got nothin' to lose 
Won't ya let me take you on a sea cruise? 

Oo-ee, oo-ee baby 
Oo-ee, oo-ee baby 
Oo-ee, oo-ee baby 
Won't ya let me take you on a sea cruise? 

I got to get t'movin' baby I ain't lyin' 
My heart is beatin' rhythm and it's right on time 
So be my guest, you got nothin' to lose 
Won't ya let me take you on a sea cruise? 

Oo-ee, oo-ee baby 
Oo-ee, oo-ee baby 
Oo-ee, oo-ee baby 
Won't ya let me take you on a sea cruise? 

Feel like jumpin' baby won't ya join me please 
I don't like beggin' but I'm on bended knee 

Oo-ee, oo-ee baby 
Oo-ee, oo-ee baby 
Oo-ee, oo-ee baby 
Won't ya let me take you on a sea cruise?
