Radio's on, feeling all right 
Cruising the strip on a Saturday night. 
I smile and I wave and I hide all my pain 
but the sign on my bumper gives me away: 

Honk if you're lonely tonight 
If you need a friend to get through the night 
A toot on your horn, a flash of your brights 
Honk if you're lonely tonight. 

I know honky-tonk where we can go. 
A booth in the back with the lights way down low. 
The jukebox is playing a sad melody 
for heart-broken lovers like you and me. 

We'll laugh and we'll flirt and we'll dance every dance 
and before the night's over we'll take a chance. 
The morning will find us with a smile on our face 
and we'll be together in a lover's embrace. 

(chorus) 

I know it seems sad to be so damn blue 
but there's always the chance that you'll meet someone new. 
I know that somewhere waiting for me 
is a sad lonely lover with a bumper that reads: 

(chorus)
