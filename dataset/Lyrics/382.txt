For the moment slipped right through him
Combed his hair, combed his hair
Knew the feeling of contentment
The actors' actor
The actors' actor
Smiled a smile uncomprehending
I took his time, took his time
Wore a hat, so he'd impress her
They took a ride
They took a ride
As I could wait for hours
I could wait and never fall down
Never fall down
Never fall down
He is down beside the river
He is down beside the river
He is down beside the river
He is down beside the river
