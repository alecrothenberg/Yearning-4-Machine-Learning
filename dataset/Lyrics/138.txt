Buddy you're a boy make a big noise 
Playing in the street gonna be a big man some day
You got mud on yo' face, you big disgrace 
Kicking your can all over the place 

Singing 
We will we will rock you
We will we will rock you 

Buddy you're a young man hard man 
Shouting in the street gonna take on the world some day
You got blood on yo' face, you big disgrace 
Waving your banner all over the place 

We will we will rock you 
We will we will rock you 

Buddy you're an old man poor man 
Pleading with your eyes gonna make you some peace some day
You got mud on your face, you big disgrace 
Somebody better put you back into your place 

We will we will rock you... singing 
We will we will rock you... everybody 
We will we will rock you
We will we will rock you
