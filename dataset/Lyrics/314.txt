Oh, girl
I'd be in trouble if you left me now
'Cause I don't know where to look for love
I just don't know how

Oh, girl
How I depend on you
To give me love when I need it
Right on time you would always be

All my friends call me a fool
They say, "Let the woman take care of you"
So I try to be hip and think like the crowd
But even the crowd can't help me now
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

Oh, girl
Tell me what am I gonna do
I know I've got a guilty face
Girl, I feel so out of place
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't know where to go, who to see
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, girl
I guess I better go
I can save myself a lot of useless tears
Girl, I've gotta get away from here

Oh, girl
Pain will double if you leave me now
'Cause I don't know where to look for love
And I don't, I don't know how

Oh, yeah
Mmm-hmm-hmm

Oh, girl
Why do I love you so, yeah
Mmmmmmm
Better be on my way, I can't stay, yeah

Have you ever seen such a helpless man
Oh-oh, no
