Everybody's talkin' at me.
I don't hear a word they're sayin',
Only the echoes of my mind.

People stoppin' starin'
I can't see the faces,
Only the shadows of their eyes.

I'm goin' where the sun keeps shinin'
Thru the pourin' rain,
Goin' where the weather suits my clothes.

Bankin' off the northeast wind,
Sailin' on a summer breeze,
Skippin' over the ocean like a stone.

Everybody's talkin' at me.
I don't hear a word they're sayin',
Only the echoes of my mind.

And I won't let you leave my love behind.
