(one, two)
ooh
wow
ooh
I feel bad, and I've felt worse
I'm a creep, yeah, I'm a jerk

Come on
Touch me, I'm sick

wow
I won't live long, and I'm full of rot
Gonna give you - girl - everything I got

Touch me, I'm sick, yeah
Touch me, I'm sick

Come on baby, now come with me
If you don't come
If you don't come
If you don't come
You'll die alone

wow
ooh

I'm diseased, I don't mind
I'll make you love me 'till the day you die

Come on
Touch me, I'm sick
ahhh
Fuck me, I'm sick

Come on baby, now come with me
If you don't come
If you don't come
If you don't come
You'll die alone
