Sittin' in a restaraunt and she walked by
I seem to recall that certain look in your eye
I said who's that you said with a smile
Oh it's nobody, aww nobody
Maybe that explains the last two weeks
You call me up dead on your feet
Working late again I ask who with
You said nobody, aww nobody

Well your nobody called today
She hung up when I asked her name
Well I wonder does she think she's being clever (clever)
You say nobody's after you
The fact is what you say is true
But I can love you like nobody can, even better

Late last night we went for a drive
You were miles away
I ask who's on your mind
You said nobody (nobody) why do you ask
Oh her again, I couldve told you that
We came back home got ready for bed
I said to myself I've got one shot left
Your still mine
And I won't stand in line behind nobody, aww nobody

Well your nobody called today
She hung up when I asked her name
Well I wonder does she think shes being clever (clever)
You say nobody's after you
The fact is what you say is true
But I can love you like nobody can, even better

(Repeat)
