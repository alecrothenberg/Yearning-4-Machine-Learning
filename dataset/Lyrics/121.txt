I want you to want me.
I need you to need me.
I'd love you to love me.
I'm beggin' you to beg me.
I want you to want me.
I need you to need me. 
I'd love you to love me.
 
I'll shine up my old brown shoes.
I'll put on a brand new shirt
I'll get home early from work
if you say that you love me.
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, 
see you cryin' (cryin, cryin').
Oh, Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, 
see you cryin' (cryin, cryin')
Feelin' all alone without a friend 
you know you feel like dyin' (dyin', dyin').
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I,
see you cryin' (cryin', cryin').
