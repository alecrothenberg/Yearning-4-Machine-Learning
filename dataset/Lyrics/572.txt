I've seen the future, I can't afford it 
Tell me the truth sir, someone just bought it 
Say mr. whispers! Here come the click of dice 
Roulette and blackjacks - gonna build us a paradise 
Larger than life and twice as ugly 
If we have to live there, you'll have to drug me 

Maybe these luxuries can only compensate 
For all the cards you were dealt at the hands of fate 
So tell me 
Tell me! tell me! How to be a millionaire 
Tell me! tell me! How to be a millionaire! 

Millionaire! Billionaire! Trillionaire! 

Hardly surprising if you might consider 
Loyalties go to the highest of bidders 
What's my opinion? I'd give you ten to one 
Give me a million, a franchise on fun 
But there are millions who often get nowhere 
And there's just one secret I think you should share 

Maybe these luxuries can only compensate 
For all the cards you were dealt at the hands of fate 
So tell me 
Tell me! tell me! How to be a millionaire 
Tell me! tell me! How to be a millionaire! 

Who wants to be millionaire? 
I do! - I don't! - I do! 
Who wants to be millionaire? 
I do! - I don't! 

I've seen the future and I can't afford it
