Me and my arrow,
Straighter than narrow
Wherever we go, everyone knows
It's me and my arrow

Me and my arrow
Taking the high road
Wherever we go, everyone knows
It's me and my arrow

And in the morning when I wake up
She may be gone, I don't know
And if we make up just to break up
I'll carry on, oh yes I will

{refrain}
Me and my arrow, Do-do-loo-do, do-do do-do do do
Straighter than narrow
Wherever we go, everyone knows
It's me and my arrow

Me and my arrow,
Me and my arrow,
Me and my arrow,
Me and my arrow,
Me and my arrow

{refrain}
Me and my arrow, Do-do-loo-do, do-do do-do do do
Straighter than narrow
Wherever we go, everyone knows
It's me and my arrow
