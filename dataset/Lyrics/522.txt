Talkin' to myself and feeling old.

Sometimes I'd like to quit;

Nothing ever seems to fit;

Hangin' around, nothing to do but frown;

Rainy days and Mondays always get me down



What I've got they used to call the blues:

Nothin' is really wrong;

Feelin' like I don't belong;

Walkin' around, some kind of lonely clown;

Rainy days and Mondays always get me down



Funny, but it seems that I always wind up-a here with you;

Nice to know somebody loves me.

Funny, but it seems that it's the only thing to do:

Run and find the one who loves me.



(*) What I feel is come and gone before:

No need to talk it out;

We know what it's all about.

Hangin' around, nothing to do but frown;

Rainy days and Mondays always get me down



Funny but it seems that it's the only thing to do,

Run and find the one who loves me



Repeat (*)



Hangin' around, nothing do to but frown;

Rainy days and Mondays always get me down
