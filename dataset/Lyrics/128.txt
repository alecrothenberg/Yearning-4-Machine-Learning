Hey, Mickey
You've been around all night
And that's a little long
You think you've got the right
But I think you've got it wrong
Why can't you say goodnight
So you can take me home, Mickey

'Cause when you say you will
It always means you won't
You're givin' me the chills, baby
Please, baby don't
Every night you still leave me alone, Mickey

Oh, Mickey, what a pity
You don't understand
You take me by the heart
When you take me by the hand
Oh, Mickey, you're so pretty
Can't you understand
It's guys like you, Mickey
Oh, what you do, Mickey, do, Mickey
Don't break my heart, Mickey

Hey, Mickey

Now when you take me by the hooves
Who's ever gonna know
And every time you move
I let a little more show
There's something you can use
Wo don't say no, Mickey

So come on and give it to me anyway you can
Anyway you want to do it
I'll take it like a man
Oh, please baby, please
Don't leave me in the damn, Mickey

Oh, Mickey, what a pity
You don't understand
You take me by the heart
When you take me by the hand
Oh, Mickey, you're so pretty
Can't you understand
It's guys like you, Mickey
Oh, what you do, Mickey, do, Mickey
Don't break my heart, Mickey

Oh, Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine, you blow my mind
Hey, Mickey, hey, Mickey
