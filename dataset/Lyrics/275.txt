she loves even better than i thought she would 
i?m on my way to her house an i?m plumb outa breath 
when i see her tonight i?m gonna squeeze her to death 

chorus 
claudette, pretty little pet claudette 
never make me fret claudette 
she?s the greatest little girl that i?ve ever met 
got the best lovin that i?ll ever get 
from claudette oh oh claudette yeah yeah claudette 

well i?m a lucky man my baby treats me right 
she?s gonna let me hug and kiss an hold her tight 
and when the date is over and were at her front door 
when i kiss her good night i?ll holler more more more

when me an my new baby have a date or three 
i?m gonna ask my baby if she?ll marry me 
i?m gonna be so happy for the rest of my life 
when my brand new baby is my brand new wife
