I travel over mountains
Down highways
Through the valleys and the bi-ways
Just to find a home in your heart

I'll bring you pretty flowers
Candy moonbeams
Fill your nights with love and sweet dreams
Just to find a home in your heart

We'll make sweet pretty music
While the birdies sing
Tie the love knot with a heart string
Just to find a home in your heart

Baby with you I travel over mountains
Down highways
Through the valleys and the bi-ways
Just to find me a home in your heart

Gotta gotta find a home
Sweet home
Help me somebody, somebody
I gotta find it, gotta got to find a home in your heart hey

Down highways
Through the valley's and the bi-ways
Just to find a home in your heart

Here I go down the freeway baby
Driving down every street trying to find you baby
Ooohh gotta gotta got to find it, somebody help me
Help me one more time, find a home in your heart, got ta

To find a home, sweet home, home, sweet florida home
