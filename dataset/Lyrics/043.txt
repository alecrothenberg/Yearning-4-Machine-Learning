Gonna break out of this city
Leave the people here behind
Searching for adventure is the type of life to find
Tired of doing day jobs with no thanks for what I do
I'm sure I must be someone
Now I'm gonna find out who

Why don't you ask them what they expect from you
Why don't you tell them what you are gonna do
You'll get so lonely, maybe it's better that way
It ain't your only you've got something to say

Do anything you wanna do
Do anything you wanna do

Don't need no politician tell me things I shouldn't need
Neither no optician tell me what I ought to see
Noone tells you nothing even when you know they know
But they tell you what you should do
They don't like to see you grow

Why don't you ask them what they expect from you
Why don't you tell them what you are gonna do
You'll get so lonely, maybe it's better that way
It ain't your only you've got something to say

Do anything you wanna do
Do anything you wanna do
