On a thousands islands in the sea
See a thousand people just like me
A hundred unions in the snow
?I watch them walking filing in a row
Feel it always on the ground
It's gonna be so quiet here tonight
A thousand islands on the sea
It's a shame

A hundred years ago a sailor
Trod this ground I stood upon
Take me away everyone
When he looks down

From my head to my toes
From the words in this book
See a vision that would bring me luck
From my head to my toes
Through my teeth through my nose
You get these words wrong
You get these words wrong
Every time
You get these words wrong
I just smile

From my head to my toes
From my knees to my eyes
Every time I watch the sky
But for these last few days leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
