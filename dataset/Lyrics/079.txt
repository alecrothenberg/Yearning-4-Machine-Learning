Cry, cry, cry
That's what I want you to do
Then think of all the lonely nights
That I've sat alone and cried over you

Cry, cry, cry
Let me see you shed a few tears
And maybe you'll realise
What I've been going through for so many years

I want you to cry cry me a river
Yes I want you to cry me a sea
Yes I want someone gonna hurt you
Just like you've been hurting me
I want you to get on your knees and cry, yeah, yeah

Cry, cry, cry
Let your tears fall like rain
Then maybe I'll realise
That my love for you is not in vain

Cry, cry, cry
That's what I want you to do
Then think of all the lonely nights
That I've sat alone and cried over you

I want you to cry cry me a river
Yes I want you to cry me a sea
Yes I know someone gonna hurt you
Just like you've been hurting me
Well I want you to go on and cry
I want you to get on your knees and cry, yeah, yeah, yeah

Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry
Hmmm
Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry
