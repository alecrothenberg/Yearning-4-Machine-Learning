I'm crucified
Crucified like my savior
Saintlike behavior
A lifetime I prayed

I'm crucified
For the holy dimension
Godlike ascension
Heavens away

I've seen the deepest darkness
And wrestled with gods
Ride the noble harness
Raining cats and dogs
I stand before my maker
Like Moses on the hill
My Guinness record baker
I abide your will

The first of reciters
I saw eternal light
Best of vocal fighters
Beyond human sight
Where thorns are a teaser
I've played a double jeux
Yherushalaim at easter
I cry I pray mon dieu
I cry I pray mon dieu

I'm crucified
Crucified like my savior
Saintlike behavior
A lifetime I prayed

I'm crucified
For the holy dimension
Godlike ascension
Heavens away

Prophets I've been reading
Stories I've been told
Before I end my breathing
I travel in the soul
Where thorns are a teaser
I've played a double jeux
Yherushalaim at easter
I cry I pray mon dieu
I cry I pray mon dieu
I cry I pray mon dieu

Adieu mon dieu

I'm crucified
Crucified like my savior
Saintlike behavior
A lifetime I prayed

I'm crucified
For the holy dimension
Godlike ascension
Heavens away

I'm crucified
for the holy dimension
Godlike ascension
Heavens away

I'm crucified
Crucified like my savior
Saintlike behavior
A lifetime I prayed

I'm crucified
For the holy dimension
Godlike ascension
Heavens away
