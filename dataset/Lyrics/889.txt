Counting backwards I count you in
I don't remember him
I don't remember
In time I rope you in again
I try and turn you back through him
I built a tower in my bones
I spill the mortar through my home
Don't let your heartbeat beat keep you safe
No telling what keeps me awake
One hundred fingerprints I hear
A hundred linger in my ear
Measure fortune killing time
