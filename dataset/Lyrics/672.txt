This thing called love I just can't handle it
This thing called love I must get round to it 
I ain't ready, crazy little thing called love 

This thing (this thing) called love (called love)
It cries (like a baby), In a cradle all night 
It swings (woooh woooh), It jives (woooh woooh) 
It shakes all over like a jelly fish, I kind of like it
Crazy little thing called love

There goes my baby, she knows how to Rock'n'Roll
She drives my crazy, she gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool cool sweat 
I gotta be cool relax, get hip! 
Get on my track's, take a back seat 
Hitch hike, and take a long ride on my motor bike
Until I'm ready, crazy little thing called love

I gotta be cool relax get hip! 
Get on my track's, take a back seat 
Hitch hike, and take a long ride on my motor bike
Until I'm ready (ready Freddie) 
Crazy little thing called love

This thing called love I just can't handle it
This thing called love I must get round to it 
I ain't ready 
Crazy little thing called love...
