Baby love
My baby love
I need you
Oh, how I need you
But all you do is treat me bad
Break my heart and leave me sad
Tell me what did I do wrong
To make you stay away so long
'Cause baby love
My baby love
Been missing you
Miss kissing you
Instead of breaking up
Let's have some kissin' and makin' up
Don't throw our love away
In my arms you're gonna stay.
Need you, need you
Oooh, baby love.
Baby love
My baby love
Why must we separate, my love,
All of my whole life through
Never loved no one but you.
Why d'you do me like you do.
I got this need
Need to hold you once again, my love,
Feel your warm embrace, my love
Don't throw our love away
Please don't do me this way
Not happy like I used to be
Loneliness has got the best of me.
My love,
My baby love
I need you
Oh, how I need you
Why d'you do me like you do
After I been true to you
So deep in love with you
Baby, baby, baby...
