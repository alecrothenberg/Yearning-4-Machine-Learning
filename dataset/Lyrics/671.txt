if you ever get close to a human
and human behaviour
be ready be ready to get confused

there's definitely definitely definitely no logic
to human behaviour
but yet so yet so irresistible

and there's no map to human behaviour
they're terribly terribly terribly terribly moody
then all of a sudden turn happy
but, oh, to get involved in the exchange
of human emotions
is ever so ever so satisfying

and there's no map
and a compass wouldn't help at all
