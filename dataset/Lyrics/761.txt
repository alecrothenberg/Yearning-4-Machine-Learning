Breadfan
Open up your mind
Open up your purse
Never, never, never gonna lose it

Breadfan
Take it all away
Never give an inch
Gotta make a mint
Gotta make a million

Breadfan
You got it wrong
Some long time friend's gonna lose it
In the end who's a fool

Seagull
Give it all away
Stay a bird
Stay a man
Stay a ghost
Stay what you wanna be

Loser
Give it all away
Never stay with the winner
With the man
With the money

Sailor
Roughin' up the town
With the gal
With a record on the top
If you're gonna be a bad boy

Breadfan
Finger in the pie
In the sky
Put a guineau on the nose
Of a gee gee

Come on
Keep it on the side
With a ride
On a throne
In the middle of an island

Loser, give it all away
Cos' I'm never gonna stay
Cos I don't need it.



Don't you feel it in your veins?
All the money in this world
And I don't need it

Breadfan
Open up your mind
Open up your purse
Never, never, never gonna lose it

Breadfan
Take it all away
Never give an inch
Gotta make a mint
Gotta make a million

Breadfan
You got it wrong
Some long time friend's gonna lose it
In the end who's a fool

Seagull
Give it all away
Stay a bird
Stay a man
Stay a ghost
Stay what you wanna be

Loser
Give it all away
Never stay with the winner
With the man
With the money

Sailor
Roughin' up the town
With the gal
On a record on the top of your van

Breadfan
Finger in the pie
In the sky
Put a guinea on the nose
Of a gee gee

Come on
Keep it on the side
With a ride
On a throne in the road
In the middle of an island
