[Chorus]
All of my love
All of my kissin'
You don't know what you've been a-missin'
Oh boy, when you're with me
Oh boy, the world can see
That you, were meant, for me

All of my life
I've been a-waitin'
Tonight there'll be no, hesitatin'
Oh boy, when you're with me
Oh boy, the world can see
That you, were meant, for me

Stars appear and shadows are falling
You can hear my heart a-calling
A little bit a-lovin' makes everything right
I'm gonna see my baby tonight

[Chorus]

Oh boy

Oh boy

All of my life
I've been a-waitin'
Tonight there'll be no, hesitatin'
Oh boy, when you're with me
Oh boy, the world can see
That you, were meant, for me

Stars appear and shadows are falling
You can hear my heart a-calling
A little bit a-lovin' makes everything right
I'm gonna see my baby tonight
