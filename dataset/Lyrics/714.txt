Who keeps on trusting you
When you've been cheating
And spending your nights on the town
And who keeps on saying that he still wants you

When you're through running around
And who keeps on loving you
When you've been lying
Saying things ain't what they seem

God does
But I don't
God will
But I won't
And that's the difference
Between God and me

So who says he'll forgive you
And says that he'll miss you
And dream of your sweet memory

God does
But I don't
God will
But I won't
And that's the difference
Between God and me
