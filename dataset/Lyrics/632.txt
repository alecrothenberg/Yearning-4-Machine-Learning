'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house,
not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
Suddenly I heard a strange noise down below,
so in my flanel pyjamas, on my tippy toe,
I couldn't see anything from the spot where I stood,
so I slid down the bannister, just as fast as I could.

All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth (thweeth)
My two front teeth (thweeth)
See, my two front teeth. (thweeth)
Gee, if I could only have my two front teeth (thweeth)
Then I could wish you Merry Chrissmass.

It seems so long since I could say:
Sister Susie sitting on a thistle
Every time I try to speak all I do is whistle: ssssssss.

All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth
My two front teeth (thweeth)
See, my two front teeth. (thweeth thweeth)
Gee, if I could only have my two front teeth
Then I could wish you Merry Chrissmass.

(Jingle Bells)

Good old Santa Claus and all his reindeer, they used to bring me lots of toys and candy
But now when I go out and call: 'Dancer, Prancer, Donner and Blitzen', none of them can understand me

All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth
My two front teeth (thweeth)
My two front teeth.(thweeth thweeth)
All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth
So I can wish you Merry Chrissmass.

Chrissmass - Chrissmass - oh, for goodness sakes: Happy New Year!
