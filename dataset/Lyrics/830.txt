I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get me no satisfaction
And I try and I try and I try t-t-t-t-try try
I can't get no I can't get me no
When I'm riding in my car
And a man comes on the radio
He's tellin' me more and more
About some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination
I can't get no uh no no no
Hey hey hey that's what I say
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get me no girly action
When I'm watchin' my TV
And a man comes on to tell me
How white my shirts could me
But he can't be a man 'cause he does not smoke
The same cigarettes as me
And when I'm flying around the world
And I'm doin' this and I'm tryin' do that
And I'm trying to make some girl
Tells me baby better come back later next week
Can't you see I'm on a losing streak
