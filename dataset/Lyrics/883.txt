Rip them down
Hold me up
Tell them that
I'm your gun
Pull my trigger
I am bigger than-

Mr. Prez in his big White House
Listen he says we're comin' out
Infiltration-we're numbin' your minds
Concentration-we've done time

[repeat chorus]

Over there the Queen she says
Let's stamp them out and dry
those tears

Saturation-we want in taxes
Flagelation-we've got gashes

[repeat chorus]

In the cold, the czars claimin'
Just protectin', rockets aimin'
Alteration-Earth is changin'
Observation-we want action

[repeat chorus]

I the Emperor proclaim
Us the masters we rule the game
Inclination-somethin' to dream on
Deprivation-we are sons

[repeat chorus]
