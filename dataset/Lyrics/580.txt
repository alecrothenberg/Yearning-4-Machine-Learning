You keep saying you got something for me  
Something you call love but confess  
You've been a'messin' where you shouldn't 've been a'messin'  
And now someone else is getting all your best  

Well, these boots are made for walking, 
and that's just what they'll do  
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you 

 You keep lyin' when you oughta be truthin'  
You keep losing when you oughta not bet  
You keep samin' when you oughta be a'changin'  
What's right is right but you ain't been right yet  

These boots are made for walking, 
and that's just what they'll do  
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you 

   LEADBREAK    
You keep playing where you shouldn't be playing  
And you keep thinking that you'll never get burnt (HAH)  Well, I've just found me a brand new box of matches (YEAH)  And what he knows you ain't had time to learn  These boots are made for walking, 
and that's just what they'll do  
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you    
SPOKEN    
Are you ready, boots?  Start walkin'
