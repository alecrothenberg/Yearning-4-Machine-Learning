You talkin' about your woman,
I wish you could see mine
You talkin' about your woman,
I wish you could see mine
Every time she starts to lovin'
She bring eye sight to the bloom

You know her daddy got some money
I can tell by the way she walk
You know her daddy got some money
I can tell by the way she walk
Every time she start to shakin'
Deaf and dumb begin to talk

Well early one morning she was lyin' on the bed 
Mel next door was dyin' and raised up his head 
And said, "Ain't she pretty? 
Uh don't you know she fine?"
One look at that woman 
Bring eye sight to the blind

I declare she pretty 
And the whole state know she fine
I declare she pretty 
And the whole state know she fine
Every time she start lovin'
She bring eye sight to the blind
