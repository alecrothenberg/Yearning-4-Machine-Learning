You'd think that people would have had enough of silly love songs.
But I look around me and I see it isn't so.
Some people wanna fill the world with silly love songs.
And what's wrong with that?
I'd like to know, 'cause here I go again
I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love you.

I can't explain the feeling's plain to me; 
Say can't you see?
Ah, she gave me more, she gave it all to me
Now can't you see, what's wrong with that
I need to know, 'cause here I go again
I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love you.

Love doesn't come in a minute,
Sometimes it doesn't come at all
I only know that when I'm in it
It isn't silly, no, it isn't silly, 
Love isn't silly at all.

How can I tell you about my loved one?
How can I tell you about my loved one?
How can I tell you about my loved one?
(I love you)
How can i tell you about my loved one?
(I love you)
