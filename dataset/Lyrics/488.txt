Won't you let me walk you home from school?
Won't you let me meet you at the pool?
Maybe Friday I can
Get tickets for the dance
And I'll take you, ooh ooh

Won't you tell your dad to get off my back?
Tell him what we said about Paint It Black
Rock and roll is here to stay
Come inside where it's okay
And I'll shake you, ooh ooh

Won't you tell me what you're thinking of?
Would you be an outlaw for my love?
If it's over let me know
If it's nowhere I can go
I won't make you, ooh ooh
