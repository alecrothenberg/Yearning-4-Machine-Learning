As I was walkin' by
Saw you standin' there
With a smile
Lookin' shy
You caught my eye
Thought you'd want to hang
For a while
Well I'd like to be with you
And you know it's Friday too
I hope you can find the time
This weekend to relax and unwind

My mind's tired
I've worked so hard all week
Cashed my check
I'm ready to go
I promise you
I'll show you such a good time

Come on baby let's get away
Let's save your troubles for another day
Come go with me we've got it made
Let me take you on an escapade (let's go)

Escapade
We'll have a good time
Escapade
Leave your worries behind
Escapade
You can be mine
Escapade
An escapade

So don't hold back
Just have a good time
We'll make the rules up
As we go along
And break them all
If we're not havin' fun
Come on baby let's get away
Let's save your troubles for another day
Come go with me we've got it made
Let me take you on an escapade (let's go)

My mind's tired I've worked
Worked so hard all week
I just got paid, we've got it made
Ready to go
I promise you I'll show you
Such a good time
Come on baby let's get away
Let's save your troubles for another day
Come go with me we've got it made
Let me take you on an escapade (let's go)

Escapade
We'll have a good time
Escapade
Leave your worries behind
Escapade
You can be mine
Escapade
An escapade
