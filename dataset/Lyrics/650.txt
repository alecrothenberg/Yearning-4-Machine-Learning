The girl works at the store, sweet Jane St. Clair
Was dazzled by her smile while I shopped there
It wasn't long before I lived with her
I sang her songs while she dyed my hair

Jane, divided, but I can't decide which side I'm on
Jane decided only cowards stay, while traitors run
Jane, Jane

I'd bring her gold and frankincense and myrrh
She thought that I was making fun of her
She made me feel I was fourteen again
That's why she thinks it's cooler if we'd just stay friends
(She thinks it's cooler being)

Jane doesn't think a man could ever be faithful
Jane isn't giving me a chance to be shameful
Jane, Jane

I wrote a letter, she should have got it yesterday
That life could be better by being together
Is what I cannot explain to Jane

The girl works at the store, sweet Jane St. Clair
(Still dazzled by her smile while I shop there)
Still dazzled by her smile while I shoplift there
(The girl works at the store, sweet Jane St. Clair)
No promises as vague as Heaven
(No promises as vague as Heaven)
No Juliana next to my Evan
(No Juliana next to)

Jane, desired by the people at her school and work
Jane is tired, 'cause every man becomes a lovesick jerk
Jane, Jane
Come on
