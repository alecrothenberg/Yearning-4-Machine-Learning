Good times
These are the good times
Leave your cares behind
These are the good times
Good times
These are the good times
Our new state of mind
These are the good times

Happy days are here again
The time is right
For makin' friends
Let's get together
How 'bout a quarter to ten
Come tomorrow
Let's all do it again

Boys will be boys
Better let them have their toys
Girls will be girls
Cute pony tails and curls
Must put an end
To this stress and strife
I think I want to live the sporting life

Good times
These are the good times
Leave your cares behind
These are the good times
Good times
These are the good times
Our new state of mind
These are the good times

A rumor has it that
It's getting late
Time marches on
Just can't wait
The clock keeps turning
Why hesitate
You silly fool
You can't change your fate
Let's cut a rug
A little jive and jitterbug
We want the best
We won't settle for less
Don't be a drag
Participate
Clams on the half shell
And roller-skates
Roller-skates

Good times
These are the good times
Leave your cares behind
These are the good times
Good times
These are the good times
Our new state of mind
These are the good times
