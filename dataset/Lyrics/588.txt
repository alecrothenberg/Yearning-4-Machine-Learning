Lump sat alone in a boggy marsh
Totally motionless except for her heart
Mud flowed up into Lump's pajamas
She totally confused all the passing piranhas
She's Lump, she's Lump
She's in my head
She's Lump, she's Lump, she's Lump
She might be dead
Lump lingered last in line for brains,
And the ones she got were sort of rotten and insane
Small thing's so sad that birds could land
Is Lump fast asleep or rockin' out with the band?
She's Lump, she's Lump
She's in my head
She's Lump, she's Lump, she's Lump
She might be dead
Lump was limp and lonely and needed a shove
Lump slipped on a kiss and tumbled into love
She spent her twenties between the sheets
Life limped along at subsonic speeds
She's Lump, she's Lump
She's in my head
She's Lump, she's Lump, she's Lump
She might be dead
Is this Lump out of my head, I think so
Is this Lump out of my head, I think so, yeah
Is this Lump out of my head, I think so
Is this Lump out of my head
