Baby, do you understand me now.
Sometimes I feel a little mad.

But don't you know that no one alive
Can always be an angel
When things go wrong I seem to be bad


But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood


Baby, sometimes I'm so carefree.
With a joy that's hard to hide.

And sometimes it seems that all I have do is worry
Then you're bound to see my other side


But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood


If I seem edgy, I want you to know
That I never mean to take it out on you

Life has it's problems and I get more than my share
And that's one thing I never meant to do
cause I love you

Oh, Oh baby don't you know I'm human
Have thoughts like any other one
Sometimes I find myself long regretting 
Some foolish thing some simple thing I've done


But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Yes, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Yes, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
