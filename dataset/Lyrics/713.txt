You say you've got to go home
'cause he's sitting on his own again this evening.
I know you're gonna let him bore your pants off again.
Oh God, it's half past eight,
You'll be late.
You say you've never been sure,
Though it makes good sense for you to be together.
Still you bought a toy that can reach the places he never goes.
Oh, now it's getting late.
He's so straight.

Do you remember the first time?
I can't remember a worse time.
But you know that we've changed so much since then,
Oh yeah,
We've grown.
Now I don't care what you're doing,
No I don't care if you screw him.
Just as long as you save a piece for me,
Oh yeah

You say you've got to go home.
Well at least there's someone there that you can talk to.
And you never have to face up to the night on your own.
Jesus, it must be great to be straight.

Do you remember the first time?
I can't remember a worse time.
But you know that we've changed so much since then,
Oh yeah,
We've grown.
Now I don't care what you're doing,
No I don't care if you screw him.
Just as long as you save a piece for me,
Oh yeah
