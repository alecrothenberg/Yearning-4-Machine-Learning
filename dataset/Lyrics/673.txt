He had a stroke at the age of 24
It could have been a brilliant career
Painting lines in a school that was too well known
Painting lines with a friend that had gone before
She challenged everyone to a fight
But the prefects all backed down
And they ran her out of town
Cause she drank and swore and spoke
Out of turn, she was the village joke
She had a stroke at the age of 24 
It could have been a brilliant career 
Getting clients to finance her strategies 
Filling time in on Safeways on Saturday 
She wears the clothes of an emperor 
But her paintings are a sham 
And they're going for a grand 
When the dealers come to view 
Do they ever see the real you?

He had a stroke at the age of 24 
It could have been a brilliant career 
Selling lies to the boys with the old Dansettes
Pulling the wool, playing the fool, it's no wonder that
He is dribbling spit tonight 
And the one he sent away 
Was the only one who stayed 
With a spoon and a decent book 
And you can tell by the way she looks he is sorry and resigned 
As he wets himself for the final time
