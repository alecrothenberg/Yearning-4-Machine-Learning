You sure you want to be with me
I've nothing to give
Won't lie and  say this love is best
Leave us in emotional peace
Take a walk, taste the rest
No, take a rest

I see you digging a hole 
Your neighborhood
You're crazy but you're lazy
No need to live in a lean to [no need to live on the need to]
your troubles must be seen to with money
Like paper with faces I remember
The faces I remember
I drink on a daily basis
Though it seldom cools my temper
It never cools my temper

Walking through the suburbs they're not exactly lovers
You're a couple, especially when your body's doubled
Duplicate, then you wait for the next kuwait

Karmacoma, Jamaican aroma [Repeat: x4]

You sure you want to be with me I've nothing to give 
Take a walk take a rest 
Taste the rest 

[Repeat: x2]
Take a walk take a rest 
Taste the rest 

Don't want to be on top of your list
Monopoly and properly kissed
We overcome in 60 seconds 
With the strength we have to together
But for now, emotional ties they stay severed
When there's trust there'll be treats and 
When we funk there'll be beats

Karmacoma, Jamaican aroma [Repeat: x4]
