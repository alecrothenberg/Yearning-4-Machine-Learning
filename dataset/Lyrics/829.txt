Have you seen her face
She's got a face that would stop a clock
And with that face I surely won't stop
To look her in the eyes
But her money's green
She's a tease like a social disease
But she's still so close to my reach
If I call, if I call at all
Any time at all [Repeat x 4]

So the story goes
I think I'll take her for a ride
With this moneybag by my side
A gigolo is the only way to go
And so I show my face
And I can even fake a smile
But I'm laughing inside all the while
This little girl
She's a joke [Repeat x 3]
Any time at all [Repeat x 4]

He's a whore, (I'd do anything for money)
He's a whore, (Look at the things that I write)
He's a whore, (Ooo, the stories I can tell)
He's a whore (In the morning, in the night) 
I'm a whore (He'll do anything for money)
I'm a whore (Look at the clothes that he wears)
I'm a whore (He'll do anything for money
I'm a whore

And so the story goes
I think I'll take her for a ride
With this moneybag by my side
A gigolo is the only way to go.
