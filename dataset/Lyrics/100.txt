[This is for you] Ooh she may be weary
And them young girls they do get weary
Wearing that same old shaggy dress
But when they get weary
[You gotta] try a little tenderness

[Tell you, might not believe it, but]
You know she's waiting
Just anticipating
The thing that she'll never, never, possess,no,no
But while [all the time] she's without it
Go to her and try just a little bit of tenderness
[Thats all you gentlemen gotta do]

Oh,but its one thing
It might be a bit sentimental yeah, yeah
She has - her greaves and care
But the soft words [they] are spoken so gentle
Yeah
But, oh, that makes it, makes it easier to bear, yeah

You wont regret it
No no,
Them young girls they dont forget it
[Cause] Love is their whole, whole happiness Yes, yes, yeah

And its all so easy

Try a little Tenderness
