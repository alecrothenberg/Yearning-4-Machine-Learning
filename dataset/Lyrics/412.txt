They call it stormy Monday
But Tuesday's just as bad
They call it stormy Monday
But Tuesday's just as bad

Wednesday's worse, Lord
And Thursday's, oh, so sad

The eagle flies on Friday
And Saturday, I go out to play
Yes, the eagle flies on Friday
And Saturday, I go out to play

Sunday, I go to church
And I kneel down and pray
And this is what I say, baby

Lord, have mercy
Lord, have mercy on me
You know I cried
Lord, have mercy
Lord, have mercy on me

You know I'm trying
Trying to find my baby
Won't somebody please
Send her home to me, yeah

Well, I cried
Lord, have mercy
Lord, have mercy on me
I said I cried
Lord, have mercy
Lord, have mercy on me

You know I'm trying
Trying to find my baby
Send her home to me
Whoa, yeah
