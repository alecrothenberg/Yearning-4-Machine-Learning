What else should I be
All apologies
What else should I say
Everyone is gay
What else should I write
I dont have the right
What else should I be
All apologies

In the sun
In the sun I feel as one
In the sun
In the sun
Married
Buried

I wish I was like you
Easily amused
Find my nest of salt
Everything is my fault
Ill take all the blame
Aqua seafoam shame
Sunburn with freezerburn
Choking on the ashes of her enemy

In the sun
In the sun I feel as one
In the sun
In the sun
Married
Buried
Married
Buried

Yeah yeah yeah yeah

All in all we all are (x13)

Gallons Of Rubbing Alcohol Flow Through The Strip

It hurts when you have to press that dull little thing
That you're only supposed to use once and then discard
Where do you put it? In the garbage can, my honest friend
My shyness, pet her flow

She's only been five months late, even though we haven't had sex for a week

A meal a day, a meal, I say
And my heart's made my ...

Somebody else already used the word 'aurora-borealis'
She was tied up in chains, and Sam had helped her in the freezer

She's only five weeks late, but I haven't had a date forever ...
Ever ... ever ... forever!

Wish I had more ... more opportunity,
More chances to remember some things
So I couldn't have so much pressure on my ...
On my ... on my, um ... ah, on my ... um ... um ... head

We'd have so much more diversity,
And so much more input, so much more creative flow,
If we had someone in school, a 'GIT' ...

GIT ... geeks ... in ... town.
Ha! ... Come on, Dave, think of one ... !
- Girls with trouble
It should be GIC, geeks with charvels
No, GWC, fuck man this is a waste of time ...

{laughs}

One more solo? Yeahhhhhhhhh! Yeaaaahhhhh!

You're ... personally responsible for, uhh ...
The entire strip ... to be washed away ...
Cleansed ... as if gallons of, um, rubbing alcohol
Flowed through the strip and were set on fire.

It didn't just singe the hair, it made it straight.
And then Perry Ellis came along with his broom,
And his ... silk ...
And he ... he erected a beautiful city ...
A city of stars.
