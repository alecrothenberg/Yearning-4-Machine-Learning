This old man I've talked about
broke his own heart,
poured it in the ground 
Big red tree grew up and out,
throws up its leaves,
spins round and round. 

I know all this and more
So take your hat off
when you're talking to me
and be there when I feed the tree 

This little squirrel I used to be
slammed her bike down the stairs
They put silver where her teeth had been
Baby silvertooth, she grins and grins


I know all this and more
So take your hat off boy
when you're talking to me
and be there when I feed the tree 

Take your hat off boy
when you're talking to me
and be there when I feed the tree 

This old man I used to be
spins around, around, around the tree
Silver baby come to me
I'll only hurt you in my dreams 

I know all this and...
I know all this and...
I know all this and more 

So take your hat off boy
when you're talking to me
and be there when I feed the tree 

Take your hat off
when you're talking to me
and be there when I feed the tree
