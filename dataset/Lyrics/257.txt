Do you remember back in old L.A. (Oh, oh, oh)
When everybody drove a Chevrolet (Oh, oh, oh)
Whatever happened to the boy next door
The sun-tanned, crew-cut, All-American male?


Remember dancing at the high school hop?
The dress I ruined with the soda pop?
I didn't recognize the girl next door
With beat up sneakers and a pony tail


Beach baby, beach baby, give me your hand 
Give me something that I can remember
Just like before we can walk by the shore in the moonlight


Beach baby, beach baby, there on the sand
From July to the end of September
Surfin' was fun we'd be out in the sun every day


Ooooh, I never thought that it could end
Ooooh, and I was everybody's friend
Long hot days
Blue sea haze
Jukebox plays
But now it's fading away


[break] 

We couldn't wait for graduation day (Oh, oh, oh)
We took the car and drove to San Jose (Oh, oh, oh)
That's where you told me that you'd wear my ring
I guess you don't remember anything


Beach baby, beach baby, give me your hand 
Give me something that I can remember
Just like before we can walk by the shore in the moonlight


Beach baby, beach baby, there on the sand
From July til the end of September
Surfin' was fun we'd be out in the sun every day


Ahhh,ahhh,ahhh
Ahhh,ahhh,ahhh


Beach baby, beach baby, give me your hand 
Give me something that I can remember
Just like before we can walk by the shore in the moonlight


Beach baby, beach baby, there on the sand
From July til the end of September
Surfin' was fun we'd be out in the sun every day
