i am a scientist - i seek to understand me
all of my impurities and evils yet unknown
i am a journalist - i write to you to show you
i am an incurable
and nothing else behaves like me

and i know what's right
but i'm losing sight
of the clues for which i search and choose
to abuse
to just unlock my mind
yeah, and just unlock my mind

i am a pharmacist
prescriptions i will fill you
potions, pills and medicines
to ease your painful lives
i am a lost soul
i shoot myself with rock & roll
the hole i dig is bottomless
but nothing else can set me free

and i know what's right
but i'm losing sight
of the clues for which i search and choose
to abuse
to just unlock my mind
yeah, and just unlock my mind

i am a scientist - i seek to understand me
i am an incurable and nothing else behaves like me

everything is right
everything works out right
everything fades from sight
because that's alright with me
