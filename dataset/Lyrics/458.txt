Oh I marched to the battle of New Orleans 
At the end of the early British war 
The young land started growing 
The young blood started flowing 
But I ain't marchin' anymore 

For I've killed my share of Indians 
In a thousand different fights 
I was there at the Little Big Horn 
I heard many men lying I saw many more dying 
But I ain't marchin' anymore 

chorus) 
It's always the old to lead us to the war 
It's always the young to fall 
Now look at all we've won with the saber and the gun 
Tell me is it worth it all 

For I stole California from the Mexican land 
Fought in the bloody Civil War 
Yes I even killed my brothers 
And so many others But I ain't marchin' anymore 

For I marched to the battles of the German trench 
In a war that was bound to end all wars 
Oh I must have killed a million men 
And now they want me back again 
But I ain't marchin' anymore 

(chorus) 

For I flew the final mission in the Japanese sky 
Set off the mighty mushroom roar 
When I saw the cities burning I knew that I was learning 
That I ain't marchin' anymore 

Now the labor leader's screamin' 
when they close the missile plants, 
United Fruit screams at the Cuban shore, 
Call it "Peace" or call it "Treason," 
Call it "Love" or call it "Reason," 
But I ain't marchin' any more, 
No I ain't marchin' any more
