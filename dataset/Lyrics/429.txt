A court is in session, a verdict is in,
No appeal on the docket today,
Just my own sin,

The walls cold and pale,
The cage made of steel,
Screams fill the room,
Alone I drop and kneel,

(And I said oh) So I held my head up high,
Hiding hate that burns inside,
Which only fuels their selfish pride,

(And I said oh) All held captive,
Out from the sun,
A sun that shines on only some,
We the meek are all in one,

I hear a thunder in the distance,
See a vision of a cross,
I feel the pain that was given,
On that sad day of loss,

A lion roars in the darkness,
Only he holds the key,
A light to free me from my burden,
And grant me life eternally,

Should have been dead,
On a Sunday morning,
Banging my head,
No time for mourning,
Ain't got no time.

(And I said oh) So I held my head up high,
Hiding hate that burns inside,
Which only fuels their selfish pride,

(And I said oh) We're all held captive,
Out from the sun,
A sun that shines on only some,
We the meek are all in one,

[Guitar break]

I cry out to God,
Seeking only his decision,
Gabriel stands and confirms,
I've created my own prison.
2x

(And I said oh) So I held my head up high,
Hiding hate that burns inside,
Which only fuels their selfish pride.
(And I said oh) We're all held captive,
Out from the sun.
A sun that shines for only some,
We the meek are all in on.

(And I said oh) So I held my head up high,
Hiding hate that burns inside,
Which only fuels their selfish pride.
(And I said oh)(I created, I created...) We're all held captive,
Out from the sun.
A sun that shines for only some,
We the meek are all in on. (my own prison)

Should've been dead on a Sunday morning,
banging my head,
No time for mourning,
Ain't got no time,
