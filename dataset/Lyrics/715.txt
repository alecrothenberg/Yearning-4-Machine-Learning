I'm a good guy for a gal 
So won't you look my palm over 
I've got time for a chat 
So won't you tell me my future 
I'm gonna break down at fifty 
And I'm not quite a stallion 
I'm a good guy for a gal 
And I'm mentally slipping 
Oh yeah, oh yeah 
What's that ya' see? 
Oh boy, find out what's up with me 
Oh yeah, oh yeah 
What's that ya' see? 
Tell me more of what's gonna be 
If you're friends with P. 
Well, then you're friends with me 
If you're down with P. 
Well, then you're down with me 
Friends of P. 
Friends of P. 
Friends of P. 
Friends... 
Somebody's fame and fortune is gonna come to me early 
I get two loves in my life, and I'm dying at 90
