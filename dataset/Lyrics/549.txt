I been warped by the rain, driven by the snow 
I'm drunk and dirty don't ya know,
And I'm still, oh I'm still 
Out on the road late at night,
I seen my pretty Alice in every head light 
Alice, Dallas Alice 

I've been from Tuscon to Tucumcari 
Tehachapi to Tonapah 
Driven every kind of rig that's ever been made 
Driven the back roads so I wouldn't get weighed 
And if you give me weed, whites, and wine 
And you show me a sign 
I'll be willin', to be movin' 

I've been kicked be the wind,
Robbed by the sleet 
Had my head stoved in
But I'm still on my feet
And I'm willin'


Now I smuggled some smokes and folks from Mexico 
Baked by the sun,
Every time I go to Mexico,
And I'm still

And I been from Tuscon to Tucumcari 
Tehachapi to Tonapah 
Driven every kind of rig that's ever been made 
Driven the back roads so I wouldn't get weighed 
And if you give me weed, whites, and wine 
And then you show me a sign 
I'll be willin', to be movin'
