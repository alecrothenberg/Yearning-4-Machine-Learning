Everybody wants to live
How they wanna live 
And everybody wants to love 
Like they wanna love 
And everybody wants to be 
Closer to Free 

Everybody wants respect 
Just a little bit 
And everybody needs a chance 
Once in a while 
Everybody wants to be 
Closer to Free 

Everybody one 
Everybody two

Everybody needs to touch 
You know now and then 
And everybody wants a good good friend 
Everybody wants to be 
Closer to Free 

Everybody one 
Everybody two

Everybody wants to live 
How they want to live 
And everybody wants to love 
Who they want to love 
And everybody wants to be 
Closer to Free
