I asked for water
Then she give me gasoline
I'd ask for water
Gave me gasoline
I asked for water
Then she give me gasoline
Lord, Good Lordy, Lord

Cried, Lord I wonder
Will I ever get back home?
Cried, Lord I wonder
Will I ever get back home?
Lord, Good Lordy, Lord

I went to the depot
Looked upon the board
I looked all over
How long had this eastbound
Train been gone?

He done taken your faror
Blown his smoke on you
He done taken yo'r
Blow'd the smoke on you
Lord, Good Lordy, Lord

Lord, I ask the conductor
'Could I ride the blind?'
'Wanna know could a broke man
Ride the blinds'
'Son, buy yo' ticket, buy yo' ticket
'Cause this train ain't none of mine

'Son, buy yo' ticket
Train ain't none of mine'
'Son, buy yo' ticket
'Son, this train ain't none of mine'
Lord, Good Lordy, Lord

'Train is none of mine'.
