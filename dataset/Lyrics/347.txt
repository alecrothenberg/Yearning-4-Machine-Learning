It's the time of the season.
When love runs high.
And this time, give it to me easy.
And let me try with pleasured hands.

To take you in the sun to (promised lands).
To show you every one.
It's the time of the season for loving.

What's your name? Who's your daddy?
(He rich) Is he rich like me.
Has he taken, any time.
(To show) To show you what you need to live.

Tell it to me slowly (tell me what).
I really want to know. It's the time of
the season for loving.
