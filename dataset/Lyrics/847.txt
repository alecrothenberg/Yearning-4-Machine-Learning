Well I have in my pocket
A hurricane fighter plane
And it takes me where I want to go
It doesn't matter if it rains
It's my hurricane fighter plane
And I know
Takes me where I want to go
To the sky up above
To the sky up above
To the ground below
There is one thing my baby
That I know I can do for YOU
And it's the only thing I know how to do
It's my hurricane fighter plane
Takes me to the sky
All the time
All the time
All the time
My my my hurricane fighter plane
My my my hurricane - fighter - plane
My my my
Come fly with me
Anytime or anywhere
When you fly with me in my aeroplane
You won't care
It'll take us over mountains
And down in valleys so deep
When the ride is over
You can go to sleep
You can go to sleep
Go to sleep
My my my my
My my my my
On the shelf I have six buckets
And they're all for you
Full of little things that we can do
You'll be amused by my hurricane fighter plane
And after we ride through the sky
It won't be the same
It'll never be the same
My my my hurricane fighter plane
My my my my
My my my my
When the ride is over
You can go to sleep
When the ride is over
My my my my
My my my my
Hurricane
Come fly with me
Anytime or anywhere
When you fly with me in my aeroplane
You won't care
You can go to sleep
My my my my
You can go to sleep
