Here comes my guy walking down the street
Look how he walks with a dancing beat
Thick wavy hair, a little too long
All day long he's singing his song
And when I see him in the street
My heart takes a leap and skips a beat
Gonna walk right up to him
Give him a great big kiss
Tell him that I love him
Tell him that I care
Tell him that I'll always be there

(Spoken) Well what color are his eyes?
I don't know he's always wearing shades
Is he tall? Well, I've got to look up
Yeah? Well I hear he's bad
MM, he's good bad, but he's not evil

Tell me more, tell me more
Big bulky sweaters to match his eyes
Dirty fingernails
Oh boy what a prize
Tight tapered pants, high button shoes
He's always looking like he's got the blues
And when I see him in the street
My heart takes a leap and skips a beat
Gonna walk right up to him
Give him a great big kiss
Tell him that I love him
Tell him that I care
Tell him that I'll always be there
