be a man ,can a mystery man,
be a doll,be a baby doll,
it can't be fun not any way,
there can be found no way at all
a distant man can't sympathise,
can't uphold his distant laws,
due to form on that today,
i got a feeling then i hear that call,i said

(chorus)

neat neat neat,she can't afford a cannon,
neat neat neat,she can't afford a gun at all,
neat neat neat,she can't afford a cannon,
neat neat neat,she can't afford a gun at all,
neat neat neat 

no crime if there aint no law,
no more cops left to mess you around,
no more dreams of mystery chords,
no more sight to bring you down,
i got a crazy,got a thought in my mind,
my mind's on when she falls asleep,
feelin' fine in her restless time,
then these words upon me creep,i said

(repeat chorus)

(solo bit) 

(repeat 1st verse)

(repeat chorus twice)
