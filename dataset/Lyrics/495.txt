You may be sweet and nice
But that won't keep you warm at night
'Cause I'm the one who showed you how to do the things you're doing now
He may feel all your charms
He may hold you in his arms
But I'm the one who let you in 
I was right beside you then

Once upon a time you let me feel you deep inside
And nobody knew and nobody saw
Do you remember the way you cried
I'm your toy I'm your old boy
But I don't want no-one but you
To love me no I wouldn't lie
You know I'm that kind of guy
