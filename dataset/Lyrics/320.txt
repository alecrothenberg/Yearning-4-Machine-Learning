Happy birthday
Happy birthday, baby
Oh, I love you so

Sixteen candles
Make a lovely light
But not as bright
As your eyes tonight

Blow out the candles
Make your wish come true
For I'll be wishing
That you love me too

You're only sixteen
But you're my teenage queen
You're the prettiest, loveliest
Girl I've ever seen

Sixteen candles
In my heart will glow
Forever and ever
For I love you so

You're only sixteen
But you're my teenage queen
Oh, you're the prettiest
Loveliest girl I've ever seen

Sixteen candles
In my heart will glow
Forever and ever
For I love you so

For I love you so
