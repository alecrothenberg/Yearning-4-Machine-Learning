Bring me home to this house of many days
Just lay me on the floor hard and cool as slate
You know I love it more and more than before I ran away
It triggers off so many hurts hurtful words and broken plates

I lied to
Now I'm fuzzy
I've been lied to

All and all the world is small enough for both of us
To meet upon the interstate waiting on a train
And just when those big arms lift up fall in love with no time to say it

I liked to
Now I'm fuzzy
I've lied to
Now I'm fuzzy
Fuzzy now

Oh oh oh

Here we are in our car driving down the street
We're looking for a place to stop have a bite to eat
We hunger for a bit of faith to replace the fear
We water like a dead bouquet does no good does it dear

I lied to
Now I'm fuzzy
We've been lied to
Now I'm fuzzy
Fuzzy now
Lied to

Oh oh oh
