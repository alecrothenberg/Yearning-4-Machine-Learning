I've got a handful of this
What do I do with it?
I've got a barrel of this
What do I do with it?
I do it clean, I do it clean

Do it clean, do it clean
Know what I mean
Do it clean, do it clean
I know what I mean, I mean

Where am I going
Where have I been
Where are you going
Where have you been
I've been here, I've been there

I've been here, there, everywhere
Here there nowhere
Iszy bitzy witzy itzy everywhere
I've been here and I've been there
I'm clean

I had a handful of this
What did I do with it?
I had a barrel of this
What did I do with it?
I did it clean, I did it clean

Do it clean, do it clean
Know what I mean?
Do it clean, do it clean
I know what I mean
