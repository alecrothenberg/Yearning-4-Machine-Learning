History never repeats
I tell myself before I go to sleep
Don't say the words you might regret
I lost before, you know I can't forget

There was a girl I used to know
She dealt my love a savage blow
I was so young, too blind to see
But anyway that's history

I say history never repeats
I tell myself before I go to sleep
Don't say the words you might regret
I lost before, you know I can't forget

You say I always play the fool
I can't go on if that's the rule
Better to jump than hesitate
I need a change and I can't wait

History never repeats
I tell myself before I go to sleep
And there's a light shining in the dark
Leading me on towards a change of heart, ah

History never repeats
History never repeats

Deep in the night it's all so clear
I lie awake with great ideas
Lurking about in no-man's land
I think at last I understand

History never repeats
I tell myself before I go to sleep
And there's a light shining in the dark
Leading me on towards a change of heart, ah

Never repeats
Never repeats
Never repeats
Hey hey
Hey
Never repeats
