Roll my tape 

Ooh, ooh, ooh 
(Gimme) Thirty days... 
Anyone doin' that one? 
Which one...?  Thirty...
I'm doin' it... 

30 days in the hole (yeah, that's nice) 
30 days in the hole 
30 days in the hole (Lord, have mercy...) 

Oh,yeah... (come on in, man, that's it. Yeah, right...)

(All right, all right, all right, all right, yeah) 

Chicago Green, talkin' 'bout Black Lebanese 
A dirty room and a silver coke spoon 
Give me my release, come on 
Black napalese, it's got you weak in your knees 
Sneeze some dust that you got buzzed on 
You know it's hard to believe 

30 days in the hole  (Oh, yeah...) 
30 days in the hole 
30 days in the hole 
That's what they give you 
30 days in the hole 
I know 

Newcastle Brown, I'm tellin' you, can sure smack you down 
Take a greasy whore and a rollin' dance floor 
It's got your head spinnin' round 
If you live on the road, well there's a new highway code 
You take the urban noise with some Durban Poison
It's gonna lessen your load 

30 days in the hole 
That's what they give you now 
30 days in the hole 
Oh, yeah 
30 days in the hole 
All right, all right 
30 days in the hole 

[Solo - break]

How you doin' boy? 
You here for 30 days... 
Get, get, get your long hair cut 
And cut out your ways... 

Black napalese, it got you weak in your knees 
Gonna sneeze some dust that you got busted on 
You know it's so hard to please 
Newcastle Brown can surely smack you down 
You take a greasy whore and a rollin' dance floor 
You know you're jailhouse-bound 

30 days in the hole  (Oh, yeah...) 
30 days in the hole 
30 days in the hole  (Oh, yeah...) 
30 days in the hole 
30 days, 30 days in this hole 
30 days in the hole 
30 days in the hole 
30 days in the hole 
[Repeat to Fade Out]
