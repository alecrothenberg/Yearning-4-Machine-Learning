Sad enough
I frequently find
There's no proof of halos
Strapped in your mind
The world passes by in a flash
From the birth of the earth
To the curse of your desperate math
We spell troubbble 

Long lasting sting
Literal swine drop
If he couldn't stand you
He's a bona fide dying tribe
The world passes by in a flash
>From the birth of the earth
To the curse of your desperate math
We spell troubbble
