Now I have nothing, so God give me strength
cause I'm weak in her wake
and if I'm strong I might still break
And I don't have anything to share
That I won't throw away into the air

That song is sung out
This bell is rung out
She was the light that I'd bless
She took my last chance at happiness
So God give me strength, God give me strength

I can't hold onto her, God give me strength
When the phone doesn't ring
And I'm lost in imagining
Everything that kind of love is worth
As I tumble back down to the earth

That song is sung out
This bell is rung out
She was the light that I'd bless
She took my last chance at happiness
So God give me strength,

God if she'd grant me her indulgence and decline
I might as well wipe her from my memory
Fracture the spell as she becomes my enemy
Maybe I was washed out like a lip-print on his shirt
See, I'm only human, I want him to hurt
I want him
I want him to hurt

[instrumental]

Since I lost the power to pretend
That there could ever be a happy ending

That song is sung out
This bell is rung out
She was the light that I'd bless
She took my last chance at happiness
So God give me strength, God give me strength
