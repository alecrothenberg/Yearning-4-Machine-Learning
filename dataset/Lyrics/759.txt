"Yo Mack, I don't even UNDERSTAND how they didn't understand you in 
that Mary joint!"
        "Yeah, I know, man."
        "Kick that ol' robotic, futuristic, George Jetson, CRAZY JOINT!!"

Just...like... Uniblab, robotic kickin' flab
My flavor be the badder
chitter-chatter
Madder than the Mad Hatter (1)
I bet you my shit come out fatter
got the data
to turn your body into antimatter (2) {...body into antimatter...}
And just like a piece of sizzlean
you'll fit inside my stomach 
with the eggs and grits between  {...take 'em down, Mack...}
The King is what I mean
I mean
my man get a cup 
and put some change inside your hand {...take 'em down, Mack...}
Now hold up, 
let's make this official  {...make it official}
everybody let's agree that M.C.'s need a tissue {..wake 'em up}
The funk's my only issue,
I bet your mama miss you
and I bet the Mack take off like an M.X. missile
No more of your whining
on the charts climbing
as I make the funk 
kickin' out more harder than a diamond  {...harder than a diamond}
And if you didn't know who's rhyming
I guess I'm gonna say Craig Mack
with perfect timing

..you won't be around next year
My rap's too severe, kickin' mad flava in ya ear {...KICK IT DOWN!}

CHORUS:
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
                {...brand new flava in ya ear...}
[time for new flava in ya ear]
                
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear

[Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear...]

Craig Mack
1000 degrees
You'll be on your knees
and you'll be burnin', beggin' please
Brother FREEZE!  {BOY!...}
Man's indisputed
and deep-booted
funk smoke that leaves your brains booted
This bad M.C.
with stamina like Bruce Jenner(3)
the winner
Tasting M.C.'s for dinner
You're crazy like that glue  {...you're crazy, boy, You're crazy.}
to think that you
could out-do 
my one-two 
that's sick like the flu  {...shake 'em down, Mack}
BOY, I flip
BOY all the time, 'cause
BOY, the rhyme you're kickin' {HAAAAAAAAA!  BOY!...}
ain't worth a dime
Seems like there's no competition
in this rap world expedition
You come around,
I'll knock you out [of] position  {... knock 'em out!}
No flav 
could ever dig a grave
for the Mack
the power pack
in black
makin' cement crack  {...make it crack...}

..and here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
                {Here- comes- the- brand- new- flavor-...
[time for new flava in ya ear]
                ...in- your- ear...         
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
                ...BOY!!!}
[Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear...]
                {Flavor down...}
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
                {Flavor, Flavor, here comes the flavor}
[time for new flava in ya ear]

I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear

[Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear...]
                {Flavor in ya ear, boy...}

HAAAAAAA!
The Mack's dope
With more hope than your Pope
but for M.C.'s more knots than rope
I'd like to break it down
down-breakin'
forsaken 
lords of M.C.'s shakin
with this track that my man's makin'
M.C.'s will run like a bomb threat
I bet           {what?}
or better yet   {huh?}
make you sweat
Gettin' hotter than the sun get  {yup!}
Craig Mack is the flav that romps
from here to Tibet     {BOY!}
I break all rules
with my action
that the Mack sends
to M.C.'s stop relaxin'
This brand new Sherrif that's in town's
gettin' down
leavin' bodies buried in the ground  {...rest in peace...}
I set up rhymes for a decoy
To off a bad boy        {OOOhhhh!}
Watch the M.C.'s I destroy and.... {BOY!!}

Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
                {time for new flavor...
[time for new flava in ya ear]
                                       ...fla-VOR!!}
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
                {time for the flav...
[Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear...]
                       ...boy, here come the Mack}
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
                {HAAAAAA!...
[time for new flava in ya ear]
              ...wakin' up with flavor!!}
I'm kickin' brand new flava in ya ear

[Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear...]
                {HAAAAAAAA!...BOY...}
