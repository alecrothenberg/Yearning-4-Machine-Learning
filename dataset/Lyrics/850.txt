Something takes a part of me
Something lost and never seen
Every time I start to believe
Something's raped and taken from me, from me
Life's got to always be messing with me (You want to see the light) 
Can't they chill and let me be free? (So do I) 
Can't I take away all this pain? (You want to see the light) 

I try to every night, all in vain, in vain
Sometimes I cannot take this place
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste
Sometimes I cannot feel my face
You'll never see me fall from grace 
Something takes a part of me
You and I were meant to be
A cheap fuck for me to lay 
Something takes a part of me

Feeling like a freak on a leash (You want to see the light) 
Feeling like I have no release (So do I) 
How many times have I felt diseased? (You want to see the light) 
Nothing in my life is free, is free 

[Chorus]
Boom, na, da, mmm, dumb, na, ema 
Da, boom, na, da, mmm, dumb, na, ema 
Go! 
So, fight! 
Something on the

Fight
Some things they fight 
So something on the
Fight
Some things they fight 
Fight
Something of the
No, some things they fight 
Fight
Something of the
Fight
Some things they fight 

[Chorus]

Part of me
Oh
