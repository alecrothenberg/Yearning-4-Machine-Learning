Well, I know a guy who's bone & skin
Women, they've been ravin' 'bout skinny Jim
Skinny Jim, man, skinny Jim
Yes yes yes, all the gals love him, skinny Jim

Well, I went to a party & skinny Jim
(2nd line imperceptible)
Skinny Jim, man, skinny Jim
Yes yes yes, all the gals love him, skinny Jim

Well, Jim got charm, he got class
All the women love him oh yeah yeah yeah
Skinny Jim, man, skinny Jim
Yes yes yes, all the gals love him, skinny Jim

(scat singing + title, x4)
Yes yes yes, all the gals love him, skinny Jim

(instrumental)

(repeat verses 2 & 3)

(scat singing + title, x4)
Yes yes yes, all the gals love him, skinny Jim
