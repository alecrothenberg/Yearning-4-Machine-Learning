Come around to my way of thinkin'
Don't you want to, want to get along?
Everyday just like a vacation with you
When I'm watchin' you and Fidel Castro in the sand, kissin'!

Girl you got to roll
Sister Havana,
Overthrow
Sister Havana

She's comin on like a bicycle army
Everybody's waitin' for the man to come down from the tower
Every day is just like a vacation with you layin' right here now
I'm watchin you and Fidel Castro in the sand, assassin!

Girl you got to roll
Sister Havana,
Overthrow
Sister Havana
Sister Havana
Sister Havana
Sister Havana

Sister Havana

There's no time to lose
I don't care what they say
There's no time to lose
We could have a holiday
But there's no time for hesitation
(There's no time to lose)
There's no time, no time for waitin'
(There's no time to lose)
There's no time so let's take the time and get it on today
(There's no time to lose)

Girl you got to roll
Sister Havana
Overthrow,
Sister Havana
Sister Havana, Sister Havana
Sister Havana, Sister Havana
Sister Havana
Come around to my way of thinkin'
Come around to my way of thinkin'
Come around to my way of thinkin'
Come around Sister
