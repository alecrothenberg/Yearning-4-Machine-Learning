I've been waiting a long time
So take me home driver
Make me more wise
And tell me more about drinking
It's evil ways and then
I will be your friend
So please be my guide
Be my light, can you really help me now
I'm lost and there's no way out
When I was young oh my ma
She used to laugh at me and cry
&quot;You'll be lonely when you die,
Couldn't change it if you tried&quot;
I've been home for so long now
So take me back will you
To the thrills of town
And tell me more about women
Yes, I had two last night
So can I be your friend now?
I've been waiting a long time
I've been waiting a long time now
Tonight, let it be my night
