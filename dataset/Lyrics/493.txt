What's he doin' in my world 
What's he doin' holdin' my world
If he's not more than just a friend 
Why were you kissin' him
And what's he doin' in my world

What's he doin' in my world 
Did you tell him that you're my girl
If your love is really true 
Tell him my world's made for two
What's he doin' in my world

Oh don't let me keep on wonderin' 
Just what you're gonna do
Wondering if the one I love 
Loves somebody new

What's he doin' in my world 
We don't need him here in our world
So if it's true he's just a friend 
Explain those kisses you gave him
And what's he doin' in my world
