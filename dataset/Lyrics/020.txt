Lucille, you won't do your sisters will,
Lucille, you won't do your sisters will,
You ran off and married, but I love you still.

Lucille, please come back where you belong,
Lucille, please come back where you belong,
I've been good to you baby, please don't lead me along.

I woke up this mornin', Lucille was not in sight,
I asked my friends about her but all their lips was tight,
Lucille, please come back where you belong,
I've been good to you baby, please don't lead me along.

Lucille, baby, satisfy my heart,
Lucille, baby, satisfy my heart,
I played love with you baby, and gave you such a wonderful start.
