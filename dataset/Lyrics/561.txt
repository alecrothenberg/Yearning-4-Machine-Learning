Are you gonna take me home tonight
Ah down beside that red firelight 
Are you gonna let it all hang out 
Fat bottomed girls, you make the rocking world go round

Hey I was just a skinny lad, never knew no good from bad
But I knew life before I left my nursery 
Left alone with big fat Fanny, she was such a naughty nanny
Heap big woman you made a bad boy out of me, Hey hey!

I've been singing with my band, across the wire across the land 
I seen every blue eyed floozy on the way 
But their beauty and their style, went kind of smooth after a while
Take me to them dirty ladies every time

Oh won't you take me home tonight? Oh down beside your red firelight
Oh and you give it all you got 
Fat bottomed girls you make the rocking world go round
Fat bottomed girls you make the rocking world go round 
Hey listen here

Now your mortgages and homes, I got stiffness in the bones
Ain't no beauty queens in this locality (I tell you) 
Oh but I still get my pleasure, still got my greatest treasure
Heap big woman you gonna make a big man out of me 
Now get this... 
Oh you gonna take me home tonight (please) 
Oh down beside your red firelight, Oh you gonna let it all hang out
Fat bottomed girls you make the rocking world go round 
Fat bottomed girls you make the rocking world go round 
Get on your bikes and ride 

Oooh yeah them fat bottomed girls 
Fat bottomed girls, Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Fat bottomed girls, Yes, yes
