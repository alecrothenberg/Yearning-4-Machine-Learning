Now that you're out of my life 
I'm so much better 
You thought that I'd be weak without you 
But I'm stronger 

You thought that I'd be broke without you 
But I'm richer 
You thought that I'd be sad without you 
I laugh harder 

You thought I wouldn't grow without you 
Now I'm wiser 
Though that I'd be helpless without you 
But I'm smarter 

You thought that I'd be stressed without you 
But I'm chillin' 
You thought I wouldn't sell without you 
Sold 9 million 

I'm a survivor (What?) 
I'm not goin' give up (What?) 
I'm not goin' stop (What?) 
I'm goin' work harder (What?) 

I'm a survivor (What?) 
I'm goin'na make it (What?) 
I will survive (What?) 
Keep on survivin' (What?)

Thought I couldn't breathe without you
I'm inhaling 
You thought I couldn't see without you 
Perfect vision 

You thought I couldn't last without you 
But I'm lastin' 
You thought that I would die without you 
But I'm livin' 

Thought that I would fail without you 
But I'm on top 
Thought it would be over by now 
But it won't stop 

Thought that I would self destruct 
But I'm still here 
Even in my years to come 
I'm still goin' be here
