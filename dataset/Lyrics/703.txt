I was so tired of being upset
Always wanting something I never could get
Life's an illusion love is a dream
But I don't know what it is

Everybody's happy nowadays
Everybody's happy nowadays

I was so tired of being upset
Always wanting something I never could get
Life's an illusion love is a dream
But I don't know what it is 'cos

Everybody's happy nowadays
Everybody's happy nowadays

Life's an illusion love is the dream
But I don't know what it is
Everyone's saying things to me
But I know it's okay okay

Everybody's happy nowadays
Everybody's happy nowadays

Everybody's happy nowadays
Everybody's happy nowadays

Life's an illusion love is a dream
Life's an illusion love is the dream
Life's the illusion love is a dream
Life's the illusion love is the dream

Everybody's happy nowadays
Everybody's happy nowadays
Todays are good

Bet you are tired of being upset
Always wanting something you never can get
Life's no illusion love's not a dream
Now I know just what it is

Everybody's happy nowadays
Everybody's happy nowadays
