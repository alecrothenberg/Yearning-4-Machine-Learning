It's a lazy day I'm down with nothing else to do
It's a crazy day I got a thing that I want to try with you
Now baby don't you go away please don't spoil my lazy day
Isn't it better didn't you know
Just sitting down here by my radio
I'm gonna make you worry none about your income tax
No there's no need to worry I'll teach you how to relax
It's a lazy day I'm down with nothing else to do
It's a crazy day I got a thing that I want to try with you
Now baby don't you go away please don't spoil my lazy day

No you don't have to think about nothing to do
When I get you down to my barbacue
I'm gonna make you feel funny
And sparkel like a brand new dime
No I don't have any money
But I always got plenty of time
It's a lazy day I'm down with nothing else to do
It's a crazy day I got a thing that I want to try with you
Now baby don't you go away please don't spoil my lazy day
