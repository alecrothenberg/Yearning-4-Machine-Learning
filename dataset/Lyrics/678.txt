No one likes us
I don't know why.
We may not be perfect 
But heaven knows we try.
But all around  even our old friends put us down.
Let's drop the big one and see what happens.

We give them money 
But are they grateful?
No  they're spiteful
And they're hateful.
They don't respect us  so let's surprise them;
We'll drop the big one and pulverize them.

Now  Asia's crowded 
And Europe's too old.
Africa's far too hot,
And Canada's too cold.
And South America stole our name.
Let's drop the big one; there'll be no one left to blame us.

Bridge:
We'll save Australia;
Don't want to hurt no kangaroo.
We'll build an all-American amusement park there;
They've got surfing, too.

Well, boom goes London,
And boom Paris.
More room for you
And more room for me.
And every city the whole world round
Will just be another American town.
Oh, how peaceful it'll be;
We'll set everybody free;
You'll have Japanese kimonos, baby,
There'll be Italian shoes for me.
They all hate us anyhow,
So let's drop the big one now.
Let's drop the big one now.
