Mother, mother
There's too many of you crying
Brother, brother, brother
There's far too many of you dying
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some loving here today

Father, father
We don't need to escalate
You see, war is not the answer
For only love can conquer hate
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some loving here today

Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me, so you can see
What's going on, what's going on
What's going on, what's going on

Mother, mother
Everybody thinks we're wrong
But who are they to judge us
Simply 'cos our hair is long
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some loving here today

Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me, so you can see
What's going on, what's going on
Tell me what's going on
I'll tell you what's going on
