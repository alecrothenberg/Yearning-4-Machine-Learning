Well I'm sittin' over here on Parchman Farm
Well I'm sittin' over here on Parchman Farm
Well I'm sittin' over here on Parchman Farm
And I ain't never done no man no harm

Well I'm puttin' that cotton in an eleven foot sack
Well I'm puttin' that cotton in an eleven foot sack
Well I'm puttin' that cotton in an eleven foot sack
With a twelve guage shotgun at my back

(pianosolo)

I'm sittin' over here on Number Nine
I'm sittin' over here on Number Nine
Well I'm sittin' over here on Number Nine
And all I did was drink my wine

Well I'm gonna be here for the rest of my life
I'm gonna be on this farm for my natural life
Well I'm a gonna be here for the rest of my life
And all I did was shoot my wife

I'm sittin' over here on Parchman Farm
