Too many teardrops
For one heart to be crying
Too many teardrops
For one heart to carry on

You`re way on top now
Since you left me
Youre always laughing
Way down at me

But watch out now
I`m gonna' get there
We`ll be together
For just a little while

And then I`m gonna put you
Way down here
And you`ll start crying
Ninety-six tears

Cry, cry

And when the sun comes up
I`ll be on top
You`ll be way down there
Looking up

And I might wave
Come up here
But I don`t see you
Waving now

I`m way down here
Wondering how
I`m gonna' get you
But I know now

I`ll just cry, cry, I`ll just cry

Too many teardrops
For one heart to be crying
Too many teardrops
For one heart to carry on

Youre gonna' cry ninety-six tears
Youre gonna' cry ninety-six tears
Youre gonna' cry, cry, cry, cry now
Youre gonna' cry, cry, cry, cry
Ninety-six tears

Come on and lemme hear you cry, now
Ninety-six tears
I wanna' hear you cry
Night and day, yeah, all night long

Ninety-six tears, cry cry cry
Come on, baby
Let me hear you cry, now, all night long
Ninety-six tears, yeah, come on now
Ninety-six tears
