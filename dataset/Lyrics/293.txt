Good evening ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Universal Amphitheatre. Well here it is, the late 1970s, going on 1985.

You know so much of the music we hear today is pre-programmed, electronic disco we never get a chance to hear master bluesmen practicing their craft anymore. 

By the year 2006 the music known today as the blues will exist only in the classical records department of your local public libraries.

So tonight, ladies and gentlemen, while we still can, let us welcome from Rock Island, Illinois the blues band of Joliet Jake and Elwood Blues. The Blues Brothers.
