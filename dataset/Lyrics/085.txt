I can't believe that it's real,
the way that you make me feel.
A burning deep down inside,
a love that I cannot hide.
Our love is you and me baby,
that makes the world go round.
And if you've been doin' lovin' with me,
layin' all my troubles down,
here I am, baby,
come and take me.
Here I am, baby,
come and take me,
take me by the hand.
Show me,
here I am, baby.

It always ends up this way,
me begging you every day.
A love that I cannot have,
you broke my heart into half.
Our love is you and me baby,
that make's the world go round.
And if you've been doin' lovin' with me,
layin' all my troubles down,
here I am, baby,
come and take me,
Here I am, baby,
come and take me,
take me by the hand.
Show me,
here I am, baby.

When I'm down I can always call you,
for a helpin' hand.
I know you'll do the best you can.
But it don't take much from me,
just my cup of joe.
Oh there's love inside me,
I believe there's one to be explodin',
It's tough for me, oh baby,
I can do worry,
tell me all your troubles.
You won't ever have to worry now,
Just one more thing, ask everybody,
everybody you see,
you'll find yourselve lost and alone on a darkened street,
here I am, baby,
come and take me.
Here I am, baby,
come and take me,
take me by the hand.
Show me,
here I am, baby...
